We will now apply different EEG referencing schemes and plot the resulting
evoked potentials. Note that when we construct epochs with ``mne.Epochs``, we
supply the ``proj=True`` argument. This means that any available projectors
are applied automatically. Specifically, if there is an average reference
projector set by ``raw.set_eeg_reference('average', projection=True)``, MNE
applies this projector when creating epochs.



.. code-block:: python


    reject = dict(eog=150e-6)
    epochs_params = dict(events=events, event_id=event_id, tmin=tmin, tmax=tmax,
                         picks=picks, reject=reject, proj=True)

    fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3) = plt.subplots(nrows=3, ncols=1, sharex=True)

    # No reference. This assumes that the EEG has already been referenced properly.
    # This explicitly prevents MNE from adding a default EEG reference. Any average
    # reference projector is automatically removed.
    raw.set_eeg_reference([])
    evoked_no_ref = mne.Epochs(raw, **epochs_params).average()

    evoked_no_ref.plot(axes=ax1, titles=dict(eeg='Original reference'), show=False,
                       time_unit='s')

    # Average reference. This is normally added by default, but can also be added
    # explicitly.
    raw.set_eeg_reference('average', projection=True)
    evoked_car = mne.Epochs(raw, **epochs_params).average()

    evoked_car.plot(axes=ax2, titles=dict(eeg='Average reference'), show=False,
                    time_unit='s')

    # Re-reference from an average reference to the mean of channels EEG 001 and
    # EEG 002.
    raw.set_eeg_reference(['EEG 001', 'EEG 002'])
    evoked_custom = mne.Epochs(raw, **epochs_params).average()

    evoked_custom.plot(axes=ax3, titles=dict(eeg='Custom reference'),
                       time_unit='s')
