Resampling data
===============

When performing experiments where timing is critical, a signal with a high
sampling rate is desired. However, having a signal with a much higher sampling
rate than is necessary needlessly consumes memory and slows down computations
operating on the data.

This example downsamples from 600 Hz to 100 Hz. This achieves a 6-fold
reduction in data size, at the cost of an equal loss of temporal resolution.

Since downsampling reduces the timing precision of events, we recommend
first extracting epochs and downsampling the Epochs object:



.. code-block:: python

    events = mne.find_events(raw)
    epochs = mne.Epochs(raw, events, event_id=2, tmin=-0.1, tmax=0.8, preload=True)

    # Downsample to 100 Hz
    print('Original sampling rate:', epochs.info['sfreq'], 'Hz')
    epochs_resampled = epochs.copy().resample(100, npad='auto')
    print('New sampling rate:', epochs_resampled.info['sfreq'], 'Hz')

    # Plot a piece of data to see the effects of downsampling
    plt.figure(figsize=(7, 3))

    n_samples_to_plot = int(0.5 * epochs.info['sfreq'])  # plot 0.5 seconds of data
    plt.plot(epochs.times[:n_samples_to_plot],
             epochs.get_data()[0, 0, :n_samples_to_plot], color='black')

    n_samples_to_plot = int(0.5 * epochs_resampled.info['sfreq'])
    plt.plot(epochs_resampled.times[:n_samples_to_plot],
             epochs_resampled.get_data()[0, 0, :n_samples_to_plot],
             '-o', color='red')

    plt.xlabel('time (s)')
    plt.legend(['original', 'downsampled'], loc='best')
    plt.title('Effect of downsampling')
    mne.viz.tight_layout()

When resampling epochs is unwanted or impossible, for example when the data
doesn't fit into memory or your analysis pipeline doesn't involve epochs at
all, the alternative approach is to resample the continuous data. This
can also be done on non-preloaded data.



.. code-block:: python


    # Resample to 300 Hz
    raw_resampled = raw.copy().resample(300, npad='auto')

Because resampling also affects the stim channels, some trigger onsets might
be lost in this case. While MNE attempts to downsample the stim channels in
an intelligent manner to avoid this, the recommended approach is to find
events on the original data before downsampling.



.. code-block:: python

    print('Number of events before resampling:', len(mne.find_events(raw)))

    # Resample to 100 Hz (generates warning)
    raw_resampled = raw.copy().resample(100, npad='auto')
    print('Number of events after resampling:',
          len(mne.find_events(raw_resampled)))

    # To avoid losing events, jointly resample the data and event matrix
    events = mne.find_events(raw)
    raw_resampled, events_resampled = raw.copy().resample(
        100, npad='auto', events=events)
    print('Number of events after resampling:', len(events_resampled))

    Resampling of the stim channels caused event information to become unreliable. Consider finding events on the original data and passing the event matrix as a parameter.
