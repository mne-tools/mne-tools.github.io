================================
Compute ICA components on epochs
================================

ICA is fit to MEG raw data.
We assume that the non-stationary EOG artifacts have already been removed.
The sources matching the ECG are automatically found and displayed.
Subsequently, artefact detection and rejection quality are assessed.
Finally, the impact on the evoked ERF is visualized.

Note that this example does quite a bit of processing, so even on a
fast machine it can take about a minute to complete.
