=========================================================================
Compute source space connectivity and visualize it using a circular graph
=========================================================================

This example computes the all-to-all connectivity between 68 regions in
source space based on dSPM inverse solutions and a FreeSurfer cortical
parcellation. The connectivity is visualized using a circular graph which
is ordered based on the locations of the regions.

Load our data
-------------

First we'll load the data we'll use in connectivity estimation. We'll use
the sample MEG data provided with MNE.



.. code-block:: python


    data_path = sample.data_path()
    subjects_dir = data_path + '/subjects'
    fname_inv = data_path + '/MEG/sample/sample_audvis-meg-oct-6-meg-inv.fif'
    fname_raw = data_path + '/MEG/sample/sample_audvis_filt-0-40_raw.fif'
    fname_event = data_path + '/MEG/sample/sample_audvis_filt-0-40_raw-eve.fif'

    # Load data
    inverse_operator = read_inverse_operator(fname_inv)
    raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif(fname_raw)
    events = mne.read_events(fname_event)

    # Add a bad channel
    raw.info['bads'] += ['MEG 2443']

    # Pick MEG channels
    picks = mne.pick_types(raw.info, meg=True, eeg=False, stim=False, eog=True,
                           exclude='bads')

    # Define epochs for left-auditory condition
    event_id, tmin, tmax = 1, -0.2, 0.5
    epochs = mne.Epochs(raw, events, event_id, tmin, tmax, picks=picks,
                        baseline=(None, 0), reject=dict(mag=4e-12, grad=4000e-13,

Compute inverse solutions and their connectivity
------------------------------------------------

Next, we need to compute the inverse solution for this data. This will return
the sources / source activity that we'll use in computing connectivity. We'll
compute the connectivity in the alpha band of these sources. We can specify
particular frequencies to include in the connectivity with the ``fmin`` and
``fmax`` flags. Notice from the status messages how mne-python:

1. reads an epoch from the raw file
2. applies SSP and baseline correction
3. computes the inverse to obtain a source estimate
4. averages the source estimate to obtain a time series for each label
5. includes the label time series in the connectivity computation
6. moves to the next epoch.

This behaviour is because we are using generators. Since we only need to
operate on the data one epoch at a time, using a generator allows us to
compute connectivity in a computationally efficient manner where the amount
of memory (RAM) needed is independent from the number of epochs.

Make a connectivity plot
------------------------

Now, we visualize this connectivity using a circular graph layout.



.. code-block:: python


    # First, we reorder the labels based on their location in the left hemi
    label_names = [label.name for label in labels]

    lh_labels = [name for name in label_names if name.endswith('lh')]

    # Get the y-location of the label
    label_ypos = list()
    for name in lh_labels:
        idx = label_names.index(name)
        ypos = np.mean(labels[idx].pos[:, 1])
        label_ypos.append(ypos)

    # Reorder the labels based on their location
    lh_labels = [label for (yp, label) in sorted(zip(label_ypos, lh_labels))]

    # For the right hemi
    rh_labels = [label[:-2] + 'rh' for label in lh_labels]

    # Save the plot order and create a circular layout
    node_order = list()
    node_order.extend(lh_labels[::-1])  # reverse the order
    node_order.extend(rh_labels)

    node_angles = circular_layout(label_names, node_order, start_pos=90,
                                  group_boundaries=[0, len(label_names) / 2])

    # Plot the graph using node colors from the FreeSurfer parcellation. We only
    # show the 300 strongest connections.
    plot_connectivity_circle(con_res['pli'], label_names, n_lines=300,
                             node_angles=node_angles, node_colors=label_colors,
                             title='All-to-All Connectivity left-Auditory '
                                   'Condition (PLI)')

    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




Make two connectivity plots in the same figure
----------------------------------------------

We can also assign these connectivity plots to axes in a figure. Below we'll
show the connectivity plot using two different connectivity methods.



.. code-block:: python


    fig = plt.figure(num=None, figsize=(8, 4), facecolor='black')
    no_names = [''] * len(label_names)
    for ii, method in enumerate(con_methods):
        plot_connectivity_circle(con_res[method], no_names, n_lines=300,
                                 node_angles=node_angles, node_colors=label_colors,
                                 title=method, padding=0, fontsize_colorbar=6,
                                 fig=fig, subplot=(1, 2, ii + 1))

    plt.show()




.. image:: /auto_examples/connectivity/images/sphx_glr_plot_mne_inverse_label_connectivity_002.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




Save the figure (optional)
--------------------------

By default matplotlib does not save using the facecolor, even though this was
set when the figure was generated. If not set via savefig, the labels, title,
and legend will be cut off from the output png file.



.. code-block:: python


    # fname_fig = data_path + '/MEG/sample/plot_inverse_connect.png'
    # fig.savefig(fname_fig, facecolor='black')
