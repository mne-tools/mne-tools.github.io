Read the data
-------------

First we'll read in the sample MEG data that we'll use for computing
coherence between channels. We'll convert this into epochs in order to
compute the event-related coherence.



.. code-block:: python


    data_path = sample.data_path()
    subjects_dir = data_path + '/subjects'
    fname_inv = data_path + '/MEG/sample/sample_audvis-meg-oct-6-meg-inv.fif'
    fname_raw = data_path + '/MEG/sample/sample_audvis_filt-0-40_raw.fif'
    fname_event = data_path + '/MEG/sample/sample_audvis_filt-0-40_raw-eve.fif'
    label_name_lh = 'Aud-lh'
    fname_label_lh = data_path + '/MEG/sample/labels/%s.label' % label_name_lh

    event_id, tmin, tmax = 1, -0.2, 0.5
    method = "dSPM"  # use dSPM method (could also be MNE or sLORETA)

    # Load data.
    inverse_operator = read_inverse_operator(fname_inv)
    label_lh = mne.read_label(fname_label_lh)
    raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif(fname_raw)
    events = mne.read_events(fname_event)

    # Add a bad channel.
    raw.info['bads'] += ['MEG 2443']

    # pick MEG channels.
    picks = mne.pick_types(raw.info, meg=True, eeg=False, stim=False, eog=True,
                           exclude='bads')

    # Read epochs.
    epochs = mne.Epochs(raw, events, event_id, tmin, tmax, picks=picks,
                        baseline=(None, 0),
                        reject=dict(mag=4e-12, grad=4000e-13, eog=150e-6))

Choose channels for coherence estimation
----------------------------------------

Next we'll calculate our channel sources. Then we'll find the most active
vertex in the left auditory cortex, which we will later use as seed for the
connectivity computation.



.. code-block:: python


    snr = 3.0
    lambda2 = 1.0 / snr ** 2
    evoked = epochs.average()
    stc = apply_inverse(evoked, inverse_operator, lambda2, method,
                        pick_ori="normal")

    # Restrict the source estimate to the label in the left auditory cortex.
    stc_label = stc.in_label(label_lh)

    # Find number and index of vertex with most power.
    src_pow = np.sum(stc_label.data ** 2, axis=1)
    seed_vertno = stc_label.vertices[0][np.argmax(src_pow)]
    seed_idx = np.searchsorted(stc.vertices[0], seed_vertno)  # index in orig stc

    # Generate index parameter for seed-based connectivity analysis.

Compute the inverse solution for each epoch. By using "return_generator=True"
stcs will be a generator object instead of a list. This allows us so to
compute the coherence without having to keep all source estimates in memory.



.. code-block:: python


    snr = 1.0  # use lower SNR for single epochs
    lambda2 = 1.0 / snr ** 2
    stcs = apply_inverse_epochs(epochs, inverse_operator, lambda2, method,
                                pick_ori="normal", return_generator=True)







Compute the coherence between sources
-------------------------------------

Now we are ready to compute the coherence in the alpha and beta band.
fmin and fmax specify the lower and upper freq. for each band, respectively.

To speed things up, we use 2 parallel jobs and use mode='fourier', which
uses a FFT with a Hanning window to compute the spectra (instead of
a multitaper estimation, which has a lower variance but is slower).
By using faverage=True, we directly average the coherence in the alpha and
beta band, i.e., we will only get 2 frequency bins.



.. code-block:: python


    fmin = (8., 13.)
    fmax = (13., 30.)
    sfreq = raw.info['sfreq']  # the sampling frequency

    coh, freqs, times, n_epochs, n_tapers = spectral_connectivity(
        stcs, method='coh', mode='fourier', indices=indices,
        sfreq=sfreq, fmin=fmin, fmax=fmax, faverage=True, n_jobs=1)

    print('Frequencies in Hz over which coherence was averaged for alpha: ')
    print(freqs[0])
    print('Frequencies in Hz over which coherence was averaged for beta: ')

Generate coherence sources and plot
-----------------------------------

Finally, we'll generate a SourceEstimate with the coherence. This is simple
since we used a single seed. For more than one seed we would have to choose
one of the slices within `coh`.

.. note:: We use a hack to save the frequency axis as time.

Finally, we'll plot this source estimate on the brain.



.. code-block:: python


    tmin = np.mean(freqs[0])
    tstep = np.mean(freqs[1]) - tmin
    coh_stc = mne.SourceEstimate(coh, vertices=stc.vertices, tmin=1e-3 * tmin,
                                 tstep=1e-3 * tstep, subject='sample')

    # Now we can visualize the coherence using the plot method.
    brain = coh_stc.plot('sample', 'inflated', 'both',
                         time_label='Coherence %0.1f Hz',
                         subjects_dir=subjects_dir,
                         clim=dict(kind='value', lims=(0.25, 0.4, 0.65)))
    brain.show_view('lateral')
