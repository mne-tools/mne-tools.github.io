=====================================================================
Compute Phase Slope Index (PSI) in source space for a visual stimulus
=====================================================================

This example demonstrates how the Phase Slope Index (PSI) [1] can be computed
in source space based on single trial dSPM source estimates. In addition,
the example shows advanced usage of the connectivity estimation routines
by first extracting a label time course for each epoch and then combining
the label time course with the single trial source estimates to compute the
connectivity.

The result clearly shows how the activity in the visual label precedes more
widespread activity (a postivive PSI means the label time course is leading).
