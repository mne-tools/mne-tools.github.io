==============================================
Compute effect-matched-spatial filtering (EMS)
==============================================

This example computes the EMS to reconstruct the time course of the
experimental effect as described in [1]_.

This technique is used to create spatial filters based on the difference
between two conditions. By projecting the trial onto the corresponding spatial
filters, surrogate single trials are created in which multi-sensor activity is
reduced to one time series which exposes experimental effects, if present.

We will first plot a trials x times image of the single trials and order the
trials by condition. A second plot shows the average time series for each
condition. Finally a topographic plot is created which exhibits the temporal
evolution of the spatial filters.

Note that a similar transformation can be applied with `compute_ems`
However, this function replicates Schurger et al's original paper, and thus
applies the normalization outside a leave-one-out cross-validation, which we
recommend not to do.
