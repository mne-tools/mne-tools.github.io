===================================================
Demonstrate impact of whitening on source estimates
===================================================

This example demonstrates the relationship between the noise covariance
estimate and the MNE / dSPM source amplitudes. It computes source estimates for
the SPM faces data and compares proper regularization with insufficient
regularization based on the methods described in [1]_. The example demonstrates
that improper regularization can lead to overestimation of source amplitudes.
This example makes use of the previous, non-optimized code path that was used
before implementing the suggestions presented in [1]_. Please do not copy the
patterns presented here for your own analysis, this is example is purely
illustrative.

.. note:: This example does quite a bit of processing, so even on a
          fast machine it can take a couple of minutes to complete.
