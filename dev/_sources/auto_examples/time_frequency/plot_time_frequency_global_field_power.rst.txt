===========================================================
Explore event-related dynamics for specific frequency bands
===========================================================

The objective is to show you how to explore spectrally localized
effects. For this purpose we adapt the method described in [1]_ and use it on
the somato dataset. The idea is to track the band-limited temporal evolution
of spatial patterns by using the Global Field Power (GFP).

We first bandpass filter the signals and then apply a Hilbert transform. To
reveal oscillatory activity the evoked response is then subtracted from every
single trial. Finally, we rectify the signals prior to averaging across trials
by taking the magniude of the Hilbert.
Then the GFP is computed as described in [2]_, using the sum of the squares
but without normalization by the rank.
Baselining is subsequently applied to make the GFPs comparable between
frequencies.
The procedure is then repeated for each frequency band of interest and
all GFPs are visualized. To estimate uncertainty, non-parametric confidence
intervals are computed as described in [3]_ across channels.

The advantage of this method over summarizing the Space x Time x Frequency
output of a Morlet Wavelet in frequency bands is relative speed and, more
importantly, the clear-cut comparability of the spectral decomposition (the
same type of filter is used across all bands).

Now we can compute the Global Field Power
We can track the emergence of spatial patterns compared to baseline
for each frequency band, with a bootstrapped confidence interval.

We see dominant responses in the Alpha and Beta bands.
