=====================
Reading an event file
=====================

Read events from a file. For a more detailed guide on how to read events
using MNE-Python, see :ref:`tut_epoching_and_averaging`.

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import mne
    from mne.datasets import sample

    print(__doc__)

    data_path = sample.data_path()
    fname = data_path + '/MEG/sample/sample_audvis_raw-eve.fif'







Reading events
--------------

Below we'll read in an events file. We suggest that this file end in
``-eve.fif``. Note that we can read in the entire events file, or only
events corresponding to particular event types with the ``include`` and
``exclude`` parameters.



.. code-block:: python


    events_1 = mne.read_events(fname, include=1)
    events_1_2 = mne.read_events(fname, include=[1, 2])
    events_not_4_32 = mne.read_events(fname, exclude=[4, 32])







Events objects are essentially numpy arrays with three columns:
``event_sample | previous_event_id | event_id``



.. code-block:: python


    print(events_1[:5], '\n\n---\n\n', events_1_2[:5], '\n\n')

    for ind, before, after in events_1[:5]:
        print("At sample %d stim channel went from %d to %d"
              % (ind, before, after))





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out::

    (array([[28771,     0,     1],
           [30450,     0,     1],
           [32101,     0,     1],
           [33712,     0,     1],
           [35428,     0,     1]], dtype=uint32), '\n\n---\n\n', array([[27977,     0,     2],
           [28771,     0,     1],
           [29652,     0,     2],
           [30450,     0,     1],
           [31240,     0,     2]], dtype=uint32), '\n\n')
    At sample 28771 stim channel went from 0 to 1
    At sample 30450 stim channel went from 0 to 1
    At sample 32101 stim channel went from 0 to 1
    At sample 33712 stim channel went from 0 to 1
    At sample 35428 stim channel went from 0 to 1


Plotting events
---------------

We can also plot events in order to visualize how events occur over the
course of our recording session. Below we'll plot our three event types
to see which ones were included.



.. code-block:: python


    fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))

    mne.viz.plot_events(events_1, axes=axs[0], show=False)
    axs[0].set(title="restricted to event 1")

    mne.viz.plot_events(events_1_2, axes=axs[1], show=False)
    axs[1].set(title="restricted to event 1 or 2")

    mne.viz.plot_events(events_not_4_32, axes=axs[2], show=False)
    axs[2].set(title="keep all but 4 and 32")
    plt.setp([ax.get_xticklabels() for ax in axs], rotation=45)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

Writing events
--------------

Finally, we can write events to disk. Remember to use the naming convention
``-eve.fif`` for your file.



.. code-block:: python


    mne.write_events('example-eve.fif', events_1)
