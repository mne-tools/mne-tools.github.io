====================================================================
Mass-univariate twoway repeated measures ANOVA on single trial power
====================================================================

This script shows how to conduct a mass-univariate repeated measures
ANOVA. As the model to be fitted assumes two fully crossed factors,
we will study the interplay between perceptual modality
(auditory VS visual) and the location of stimulus presentation
(left VS right). Here we use single trials as replications
(subjects) while iterating over time slices plus frequency bands
for to fit our mass-univariate model. For the sake of simplicity we
will confine this analysis to one single channel of which we know
that it exposes a strong induced response. We will then visualize
each effect by creating a corresponding mass-univariate effect
image. We conclude with accounting for multiple comparisons by
performing a permutation clustering test using the ANOVA as
clustering function. The results final will be compared to
multiple comparisons using False Discovery Rate correction.

We have to make sure all conditions have the same counts, as the ANOVA
expects a fully balanced data matrix and does not forgive imbalances that
generously (risk of type-I error).

    n_cycles = freqs / freqs[0]
    zero_mean = False  # don't correct morlet wavelet to be of mean zero
    # To have a true wavelet zero_mean should be True but here for illustration
    # purposes it helps to spot the evoked response.

        this_tfr = tfr_morlet(condition, freqs, n_cycles=n_cycles,

Setup repeated measures ANOVA
-----------------------------

We will tell the ANOVA how to interpret the data matrix in terms of factors.
This is done via the factor levels argument which is a list of the number
factor levels for each factor.


.. code-block:: python


    n_conditions = len(epochs.event_id)
    n_replications = epochs.events.shape[0] // n_conditions

    factor_levels = [2, 2]  # number of levels in each factor
    effects = 'A*B'  # this is the default signature for computing all effects
    # Other possible options are 'A' or 'B' for the corresponding main effects
    # or 'A:B' for the interaction effect only (this notation is borrowed from the
    # R formula language)
    n_freqs = len(freqs)
    times = 1e3 * epochs.times[::decim]
    n_times = len(times)







Now we'll assemble the data matrix and swap axes so the trial replications
are the first dimension and the conditions are the second dimension.


.. code-block:: python

    data = np.swapaxes(np.asarray(epochs_power), 1, 0)
    # reshape last two dimensions in one mass-univariate observation-vector
    data = data.reshape(n_replications, n_conditions, n_freqs * n_times)

    # so we have replications * conditions * observations:
    print(data.shape)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    (56, 4, 1688)


While the iteration scheme used above for assembling the data matrix
makes sure the first two dimensions are organized as expected (with A =
modality and B = location):

.. table:: Sample data layout

   ===== ==== ==== ==== ====
   trial A1B1 A1B2 A2B1 B2B2
   ===== ==== ==== ==== ====
   1     1.34 2.53 0.97 1.74
   ...   ...  ...  ...  ...
   56    2.45 7.90 3.09 4.76
   ===== ==== ==== ==== ====

Now we're ready to run our repeated measures ANOVA.

Note. As we treat trials as subjects, the test only accounts for
time locked responses despite the 'induced' approach.
For analysis for induced power at the group level averaged TRFs
are required.


.. code-block:: python


    fvals, pvals = f_mway_rm(data, factor_levels, effects=effects)

    effect_labels = ['modality', 'location', 'modality by location']

    # let's visualize our effects by computing f-images
    for effect, sig, effect_label in zip(fvals, pvals, effect_labels):
        plt.figure()
        # show naive F-values in gray
        plt.imshow(effect.reshape(8, 211), cmap=plt.cm.gray, extent=[times[0],
                   times[-1], freqs[0], freqs[-1]], aspect='auto',
                   origin='lower')
        # create mask for significant Time-frequency locations
        effect = np.ma.masked_array(effect, [sig > .05])
        plt.imshow(effect.reshape(8, 211), cmap='RdBu_r', extent=[times[0],
                   times[-1], freqs[0], freqs[-1]], aspect='auto',
                   origin='lower')
        plt.colorbar()
        plt.xlabel('Time (ms)')
        plt.ylabel('Frequency (Hz)')
        plt.title(r"Time-locked response for '%s' (%s)" % (effect_label, ch_name))
        plt.show()

Account for multiple comparisons using FDR versus permutation clustering test
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

First we need to slightly modify the ANOVA function to be suitable for
the clustering procedure. Also want to set some defaults.
Let's first override effects to confine the analysis to the interaction


.. code-block:: python

    effects = 'A:B'







A stat_fun must deal with a variable number of input arguments.
Inside the clustering function each condition will be passed as flattened
array, necessitated by the clustering procedure. The ANOVA however expects an
input array of dimensions: subjects X conditions X observations (optional).
The following function catches the list input and swaps the first and
the second dimension and finally calls the ANOVA function.


.. code-block:: python



    def stat_fun(*args):
        return f_mway_rm(np.swapaxes(args, 1, 0), factor_levels=factor_levels,
                         effects=effects, return_pvals=False)[0]


    # The ANOVA returns a tuple f-values and p-values, we will pick the former.
    pthresh = 0.001  # set threshold rather high to save some time
    f_thresh = f_threshold_mway_rm(n_replications, factor_levels, effects,
                                   pthresh)
    tail = 1  # f-test, so tail > 0
    n_permutations = 256  # Save some time (the test won't be too sensitive ...)
    T_obs, clusters, cluster_p_values, h0 = mne.stats.permutation_cluster_test(
        epochs_power, stat_fun=stat_fun, threshold=f_thresh, tail=tail, n_jobs=1,
        n_permutations=n_permutations, buffer_size=None)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Running initial clustering

    Computing cluster p-values
    Done.


Create new stats image with only significant clusters:


.. code-block:: python


    good_clusters = np.where(cluster_p_values < .05)[0]
    T_obs_plot = np.ma.masked_array(T_obs,
                                    np.invert(clusters[np.squeeze(good_clusters)]))

    plt.figure()
    for f_image, cmap in zip([T_obs, T_obs_plot], [plt.cm.gray, 'RdBu_r']):
        plt.imshow(f_image, cmap=cmap, extent=[times[0], times[-1],
                   freqs[0], freqs[-1]], aspect='auto',
                   origin='lower')
    plt.xlabel('Time (ms)')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency (Hz)')
    plt.title("Time-locked response for 'modality by location' (%s)\n"
              " cluster-level corrected (p <= 0.05)" % ch_name)
    plt.show()




.. image:: /auto_tutorials/images/sphx_glr_plot_stats_cluster_time_frequency_repeated_measures_anova_004.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




Now using FDR:


.. code-block:: python


    mask, _ = fdr_correction(pvals[2])
    T_obs_plot2 = np.ma.masked_array(T_obs, np.invert(mask))

    plt.figure()
    for f_image, cmap in zip([T_obs, T_obs_plot2], [plt.cm.gray, 'RdBu_r']):
        plt.imshow(f_image, cmap=cmap, extent=[times[0], times[-1],
                   freqs[0], freqs[-1]], aspect='auto',
                   origin='lower')

    plt.xlabel('Time (ms)')
    plt.ylabel('Frequency (Hz)')
    plt.title("Time-locked response for 'modality by location' (%s)\n"
              " FDR corrected (p <= 0.05)" % ch_name)
    plt.show()




.. image:: /auto_tutorials/images/sphx_glr_plot_stats_cluster_time_frequency_repeated_measures_anova_005.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




Both cluster level and FDR correction help get rid of
putatively spots we saw in the naive f-images.
