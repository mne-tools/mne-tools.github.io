The role of dipole orientations in distributed source localization
==================================================================

When performing source localization in a distributed manner
(MNE/dSPM/sLORETA/eLORETA),
the source space is defined as a grid of dipoles that spans a large portion of
the cortex. These dipoles have both a position and an orientation. In this
tutorial, we will look at the various options available to restrict the
orientation of the dipoles and the impact on the resulting source estimate.

The source space
----------------
Let's start by examining the source space as constructed by the
:func:`mne.setup_source_space` function. Dipoles are placed along fixed
intervals on the cortex, determined by the ``spacing`` parameter. The source
space does not define the orientation for these dipoles.


.. code-block:: python


    lh = fwd['src'][0]  # Visualize the left hemisphere
    verts = lh['rr']  # The vertices of the source space
    tris = lh['tris']  # Groups of three vertices that form triangles
    dip_pos = lh['rr'][lh['vertno']]  # The position of the dipoles
    white = (1.0, 1.0, 1.0)  # RGB values for a white color
    gray = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)  # RGB values for a gray color
    red = (1.0, 0.0, 0.0)  # RGB valued for a red color

    mlab.figure(size=(600, 400), bgcolor=white)

    # Plot the cortex
    mlab.triangular_mesh(verts[:, 0], verts[:, 1], verts[:, 2], tris, color=gray)

    # Mark the position of the dipoles with small red dots
    mlab.points3d(dip_pos[:, 0], dip_pos[:, 1], dip_pos[:, 2], color=red,
                  scale_factor=1E-3)

    mlab.view(azimuth=180, distance=0.25)

    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




Fixed dipole orientations
-------------------------
While the source space defines the position of the dipoles, the inverse
operator defines the possible orientations of them. One of the options is to
assign a fixed orientation. Since the neural currents from which MEG and EEG
signals originate flows mostly perpendicular to the cortex [1]_, restricting
the orientation of the dipoles accordingly places a useful restriction on the
source estimate.

By specifying ``fixed=True`` when calling
:func:`mne.minimum_norm.make_inverse_operator`, the dipole orientations are
fixed to be orthogonal to the surface of the cortex, pointing outwards. Let's
visualize this:


.. code-block:: python


    mlab.figure(size=(600, 400), bgcolor=white)

    # Plot the cortex
    mlab.triangular_mesh(verts[:, 0], verts[:, 1], verts[:, 2], tris, color=gray)

    # Show the dipoles as arrows pointing along the surface normal
    normals = lh['nn'][lh['vertno']]
    mlab.quiver3d(dip_pos[:, 0], dip_pos[:, 1], dip_pos[:, 2],
                  normals[:, 0], normals[:, 1], normals[:, 2],
                  color=red, scale_factor=1E-3)

    mlab.view(azimuth=180, distance=0.1)




.. image:: /auto_tutorials/images/sphx_glr_plot_dipole_orientations_002.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




Restricting the dipole orientations in this manner leads to the following
source estimate for the sample data:


.. code-block:: python


    # Compute the source estimate for the 'left - auditory' condition in the sample
    # dataset.
    inv = make_inverse_operator(left_auditory.info, fwd, noise_cov, fixed=True)
    stc = apply_inverse(left_auditory, inv, pick_ori=None)

    # Visualize it at the moment of peak activity.
    _, time_max = stc.get_peak(hemi='lh')
    brain = stc.plot(surface='white', subjects_dir=subjects_dir,
                     initial_time=time_max, time_unit='s', size=(600, 400))

The direction of the estimated current is now restricted to two directions:
inward and outward. In the plot, blue areas indicate current flowing inwards
and red areas indicate current flowing outwards. Given the curvature of the
cortex, groups of dipoles tend to point in the same direction: the direction
of the electromagnetic field picked up by the sensors.

Loose dipole orientations
-------------------------
Forcing the source dipoles to be strictly orthogonal to the cortex makes the
source estimate sensitive to the spacing of the dipoles along the cortex,
since the curvature of the cortex changes within each ~10 square mm patch.
Furthermore, misalignment of the MEG/EEG and MRI coordinate frames is more
critical when the source dipole orientations are strictly constrained [2]_.
To lift the restriction on the orientation of the dipoles, the inverse
operator has the ability to place not one, but three dipoles at each
location defined by the source space. These three dipoles are placed
orthogonally to form a Cartesian coordinate system. Let's visualize this:


.. code-block:: python

    mlab.figure(size=(600, 400), bgcolor=white)

    # Define some more colors
    green = (0.0, 1.0, 0.0)
    blue = (0.0, 0.0, 1.0)

    # Plot the cortex
    mlab.triangular_mesh(verts[:, 0], verts[:, 1], verts[:, 2], tris, color=gray)

    # Make an inverse operator with loose dipole orientations
    inv = make_inverse_operator(left_auditory.info, fwd, noise_cov, fixed=False,
                                loose=1.0)

    # Show the three dipoles defined at each location in the source space
    dip_dir = inv['source_nn'].reshape(-1, 3, 3)
    dip_dir = dip_dir[:len(dip_pos)]  # Only select left hemisphere
    for ori, color in zip((0, 1, 2), (red, green, blue)):
        mlab.quiver3d(dip_pos[:, 0], dip_pos[:, 1], dip_pos[:, 2],
                      dip_dir[:, ori, 0], dip_dir[:, ori, 1], dip_dir[:, ori, 2],
                      color=color, scale_factor=1E-3)

When computing the source estimate, the activity at each of the three dipoles
is collapsed into the XYZ components of a single vector, which leads to the
following source estimate for the sample data:


.. code-block:: python


    # Compute the source estimate, indicate that we want a vector solution
    stc = apply_inverse(left_auditory, inv, pick_ori='vector')

    # Visualize it at the moment of peak activity.
    _, time_max = stc.magnitude().get_peak(hemi='lh')
    brain = stc.plot(subjects_dir=subjects_dir, initial_time=time_max,
                     time_unit='s', size=(600, 400), overlay_alpha=0)

Limiting orientations, but not fixing them
------------------------------------------
Often, the best results will be obtained by allowing the dipoles to have
somewhat free orientation, but not stray too far from a orientation that is
perpendicular to the cortex. The ``loose`` parameter of the
:func:`mne.minimum_norm.make_inverse_operator` allows you to specify a value
between 0 (fixed) and 1 (unrestricted or "free") to indicate the amount the
orientation is allowed to deviate from the surface normal.


.. code-block:: python


    # Set loose to 0.2, the default value
    inv = make_inverse_operator(left_auditory.info, fwd, noise_cov, fixed=False,
                                loose=0.2)
    stc = apply_inverse(left_auditory, inv, pick_ori='vector')

    # Visualize it at the moment of peak activity.
    _, time_max = stc.magnitude().get_peak(hemi='lh')
    brain = stc.plot(subjects_dir=subjects_dir, initial_time=time_max,
                     time_unit='s', size=(600, 400), overlay_alpha=0)

Discarding dipole orientation information
-----------------------------------------
Often, further analysis of the data does not need information about the
orientation of the dipoles, but rather their magnitudes. The ``pick_ori``
parameter of the :func:`mne.minimum_norm.apply_inverse` function allows you
to specify whether to return the full vector solution (``'vector'``) or
rather the magnitude of the vectors (``None``, the default) or only the
activity in the direction perpendicular to the cortex (``'normal'``).


.. code-block:: python


    # Only retain vector magnitudes
    stc = apply_inverse(left_auditory, inv, pick_ori=None)

    # Visualize it at the moment of peak activity.
    _, time_max = stc.get_peak(hemi='lh')
    brain = stc.plot(surface='white', subjects_dir=subjects_dir,
                     initial_time=time_max, time_unit='s', size=(600, 400))
