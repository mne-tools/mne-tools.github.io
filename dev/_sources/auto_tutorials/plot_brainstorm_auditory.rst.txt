====================================
Brainstorm auditory tutorial dataset
====================================

Here we compute the evoked from raw for the auditory Brainstorm
tutorial dataset. For comparison, see [1]_ and the associated
`brainstorm site <http://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Tutorials/Auditory>`_.

Experiment:

    - One subject, 2 acquisition runs 6 minutes each.
    - Each run contains 200 regular beeps and 40 easy deviant beeps.
    - Random ISI: between 0.7s and 1.7s seconds, uniformly distributed.
    - Button pressed when detecting a deviant with the right index finger.

The specifications of this dataset were discussed initially on the
`FieldTrip bug tracker <http://bugzilla.fcdonders.nl/show_bug.cgi?id=2300>`_.

To reduce memory consumption and running time, some of the steps are
precomputed. To run everything from scratch change this to False. With
``use_precomputed = False`` running time of this script can be several
minutes even on a fast computer.


.. code-block:: python

    use_precomputed = True







The data was collected with a CTF 275 system at 2400 Hz and low-pass
filtered at 600 Hz. Here the data and empty room data files are read to
construct instances of :class:`mne.io.Raw`.


.. code-block:: python

    data_path = bst_auditory.data_path()

    subject = 'bst_auditory'
    subjects_dir = op.join(data_path, 'subjects')

    raw_fname1 = op.join(data_path, 'MEG', 'bst_auditory',
                         'S01_AEF_20131218_01.ds')
    raw_fname2 = op.join(data_path, 'MEG', 'bst_auditory',
                         'S01_AEF_20131218_02.ds')

                        'S01_Noise_20131218_01.ds')







In the memory saving mode we use ``preload=False`` and use the memory
efficient IO which loads the data on demand. However, filtering and some
other functions require the data to be preloaded in the memory.


.. code-block:: python

    preload = not use_precomputed
    raw = read_raw_ctf(raw_fname1, preload=preload)
    n_times_run1 = raw.n_times
    mne.io.concatenate_raws([raw, read_raw_ctf(raw_fname2, preload=preload)])
    raw_erm = read_raw_ctf(erm_fname, preload=preload)

Data channel array consisted of 274 MEG axial gradiometers, 26 MEG reference
sensors and 2 EEG electrodes (Cz and Pz).
In addition:

  - 1 stim channel for marking presentation times for the stimuli
  - 1 audio channel for the sent signal
  - 1 response channel for recording the button presses
  - 1 ECG bipolar
  - 2 EOG bipolar (vertical and horizontal)
  - 12 head tracking channels
  - 20 unused channels

The head tracking channels and the unused channels are marked as misc
channels. Here we define the EOG and ECG channels.

For noise reduction, a set of bad segments have been identified and stored
in csv files. The bad segments are later used to reject epochs that overlap
with them.
The file for the second run also contains some saccades. The saccades are
removed by using SSP. We use pandas to read the data from the csv files. You
can also view the files with your favorite text editor.

Typical preprocessing step is the removal of power line artifact (50 Hz or
60 Hz). Here we notch filter the data at 60, 120 and 180 to remove the
original 60 Hz artifact and the harmonics. The power spectra are plotted
before and after the filtering to show the effect. The drop after 600 Hz
appears because the data was filtered during the acquisition. In memory
saving mode we do the filtering at evoked stage, which is not something you
usually would do.

We mark a set of bad channels that seem noisier than others. This can also
be done interactively with ``raw.plot`` by clicking the channel name
(or the line). The marked channels are added as bad when the browser window
is closed.

The epochs (trials) are created for MEG channels. First we find the picks
for MEG and EOG channels. Then the epochs are constructed using these picks.
The epochs overlapping with annotated bad segments are also rejected by
default. To turn off rejection by bad segments (as was done earlier with
saccades) you can use keyword ``reject_by_annotation=False``.

Typical preprocessing step is the removal of power line artifact (50 Hz or
60 Hz). Here we lowpass filter the data at 40 Hz, which will remove all
line artifacts (and high frequency information). Normally this would be done
to raw data (with :func:`mne.io.Raw.filter`), but to reduce memory
consumption of this tutorial, we do it at evoked stage. (At the raw stage,
you could alternatively notch filter with :func:`mne.io.Raw.notch_filter`.)

        evoked.filter(l_freq=None, h_freq=40., fir_design='firwin')

Here we plot the ERF of standard and deviant conditions. In both conditions
we can see the P50 and N100 responses. The mismatch negativity is visible
only in the deviant condition around 100-200 ms. P200 is also visible around
170 ms in both conditions but much stronger in the standard condition. P300
is visible in deviant condition only (decision making in preparation of the
button press). You can view the topographies from a certain time span by
painting an area with clicking and holding the left mouse button.

We can see the MMN effect more clearly by looking at the difference between
the two conditions. P50 and N100 are no longer visible, but MMN/P200 and
P300 are emphasised.
