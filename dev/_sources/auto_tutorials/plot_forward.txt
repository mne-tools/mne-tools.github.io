Head model and forward computation
==================================

The aim of this tutorial is to be a getting started for forward
computation.

For more extensive details and presentation of the general
concepts for forward modeling. See :ref:`ch_forward`.




.. code-block:: python


    import mne
    from mne.datasets import sample
    data_path = sample.data_path()

    # the raw file containing the channel location + types
    raw_fname = data_path + '/MEG/sample/sample_audvis_raw.fif'
    # The paths to freesurfer reconstructions
    subjects_dir = data_path + '/subjects'
    subject = 'sample'







Computing the forward operator
------------------------------

To compute a forward operator we need:

   - a ``-trans.fif`` file that contains the coregistration info.
   - a source space
   - the BEM surfaces


Compute and visualize BEM surfaces
----------------------------------

The BEM surfaces are the triangulations of the interfaces between different
tissues needed for forward computation. These surfaces are for example
the inner skull surface, the outer skull surface and the outer skill
surface.

Computing the BEM surfaces requires FreeSurfer and makes use of either of
the two following command line tools:

  - :ref:`gen_mne_watershed_bem`
  - :ref:`gen_mne_flash_bem`

Here we'll assume it's already computed. It takes a few minutes per subject.

For EEG we use 3 layers (inner skull, outer skull, and skin) while for
MEG 1 layer (inner skull) is enough.

Let's look at these surfaces. The function :func:`mne.viz.plot_bem`
assumes that you have the the *bem* folder of your subject FreeSurfer
reconstruction the necessary files.



.. code-block:: python


    mne.viz.plot_bem(subject=subject, subjects_dir=subjects_dir,
                     orientation='coronal')

Visualization the coregistration
--------------------------------

The coregistration is operation that allows to position the head and the
sensors in a common coordinate system. In the MNE software the transformation
to align the head and the sensors in stored in a so-called **trans file**.
It is a FIF file that ends with -trans.fif. It can be obtained with
mne_analyze (Unix tools), mne.gui.coregistration (in Python) or mrilab
if you're using a Neuromag system.

For the Python version see func:`mne.gui.coregistration`

Here we assume the coregistration is done, so we just visually check the
alignment with the following code.



.. code-block:: python


    # The transformation file obtained by coregistration
    trans = data_path + '/MEG/sample/sample_audvis_raw-trans.fif'

    info = mne.io.read_info(raw_fname)
    mne.viz.plot_trans(info, trans, subject=subject, dig=True,
                       meg_sensors=True, subjects_dir=subjects_dir)

Compute Source Space
--------------------

The source space defines the position of the candidate source locations.
The following code compute such a cortical source space with
an OCT-6 resolution.

See :ref:`setting_up_source_space` for details on source space definition
and spacing parameter.



.. code-block:: python


    src = mne.setup_source_space(subject, spacing='oct6',
                                 subjects_dir=subjects_dir,
                                 add_dist=False, overwrite=True)
    print(src)

Compute forward solution
------------------------

We can now compute the forward solution.
To reduce computation we'll just compute a single layer BEM (just inner
skull) that can then be used for MEG (not EEG).

We specify if we want a one-layer or a three-layer BEM using the
conductivity parameter.

The BEM solution requires a BEM model which describes the geometry
of the head the conductivities of the different tissues.



.. code-block:: python


    conductivity = (0.3,)  # for single layer
    # conductivity = (0.3, 0.006, 0.3)  # for three layers
    model = mne.make_bem_model(subject='sample', ico=4,
                               conductivity=conductivity,
                               subjects_dir=subjects_dir)
    bem = mne.make_bem_solution(model)

Note that the BEM does not involve any use of the trans file. The BEM
only depends on the head geometry and conductivities.
It is therefore independent from the MEG data and the head position.

Let's now compute the forward operator, commonly referred to as the
gain or leadfield matrix.

See :func:`mne.make_forward_solution` for details on parameters meaning.



.. code-block:: python


    fwd = mne.make_forward_solution(raw_fname, trans=trans, src=src, bem=bem,

We can explore the content of fwd to access the numpy array that contains
the gain matrix.

    leadfield = fwd['sol']['data']
    print("Leadfield size : %d sensors x %d dipoles" % leadfield.shape)

To save to disk a forward solution you can use
:func:`mne.write_forward_solution` and to read it back from disk
:func:`mne.read_forward_solution`. Don't forget that FIF files containing
forward solution should end with *-fwd.fif*.


Exercise
--------

By looking at :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_forward_plot_read_forward.py`
plot the sensitivity maps for EEG and compare it with the MEG, can you
justify the claims that:

  - MEG is not sensitive to radial sources
  - EEG is more sensitive to deep sources

How will the MEG sensitivity maps and histograms change if you use a free
instead if a fixed/surface oriented orientation?

Try this changing the mode parameter in :func:`mne.sensitivity_map`
accordingly. Why don't we see any dipoles on the gyri?
