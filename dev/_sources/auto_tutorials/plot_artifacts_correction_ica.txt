Artifact Correction with ICA
============================

ICA finds directions in the feature space
corresponding to projections with high non-Gaussianity. We thus obtain
a decomposition into independent components, and the artifact's contribution
is localized in only a small number of components.
These components have to be correctly identified and removed.

If EOG or ECG recordings are available, they can be used in ICA to
automatically select the corresponding artifact components from the
decomposition. To do so, you have to first build an Epoch object around
blink or heartbeat event.

    raw.filter(1, 40, n_jobs=2)  # 1Hz high pass is often helpful for fitting ICA

Fit ICA
-------

ICA parameters:



.. code-block:: python


    n_components = 25  # if float, select n_components by explained variance of PCA
    method = 'fastica'  # for comparison with EEGLAB try "extended-infomax" here
    decim = 3  # we need sufficient statistics, not all time points -> saves time

    # we will also set state of the random number generator - ICA is a
    # non-deterministic algorithm, but we want to have the same decomposition
    # and the same order of components each time this tutorial is run
    random_state = 23







Define the ICA object instance



.. code-block:: python

    ica = ICA(n_components=n_components, method=method, random_state=random_state)
    print(ica)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

    ica.fit(raw, picks=picks_meg, decim=decim, reject=reject)
    print(ica)

Component properties
--------------------

Let's take a closer look at properties of first three independent components.



.. code-block:: python


    # first, component 0:
    ica.plot_properties(raw, picks=0)




.. image:: /auto_tutorials/images/sphx_glr_plot_artifacts_correction_ica_003.png
    :align: center




we can see that the data were filtered so the spectrum plot is not
very informative, let's change that:



.. code-block:: python

    ica.plot_properties(raw, picks=0, psd_args={'fmax': 35.})




.. image:: /auto_tutorials/images/sphx_glr_plot_artifacts_correction_ica_004.png
    :align: center




we can also take a look at multiple different components at once:



.. code-block:: python

    ica.plot_properties(raw, picks=[1, 2], psd_args={'fmax': 35.})




.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-horizontal


    *

            :scale: 47




Instead of opening individual figures with component properties, we can
also pass an instance of Raw or Epochs in ``inst`` arument to
``ica.plot_components``. This would allow us to open component properties
interactively by clicking on individual component topomaps. In the notebook
this woks only when running matplotlib in interactive mode (``%matplotlib``).



.. code-block:: python


    # uncomment the code below to test the inteactive mode of plot_components:
    # ica.plot_components(picks=range(10), inst=raw)







Advanced artifact detection
---------------------------

Let's use a more efficient way to find artefacts



.. code-block:: python


    eog_average = create_eog_epochs(raw, reject=dict(mag=5e-12, grad=4000e-13),
                                    picks=picks_meg).average()

    # We simplify things by setting the maximum number of components to reject
    n_max_eog = 1  # here we bet on finding the vertical EOG components
    eog_epochs = create_eog_epochs(raw, reject=reject)  # get single EOG trials
    eog_inds, scores = ica.find_bads_eog(eog_epochs)  # find via correlation

    ica.plot_scores(scores, exclude=eog_inds)  # look at r scores of components
    # we can see that only one component is highly correlated and that this
    # component got detected by our correlation analysis (red).

    ica.plot_sources(eog_average, exclude=eog_inds)  # look at source time course

We can take a look at the properties of that component, now using the
data epoched with respect to EOG events.
We will also use a little bit of smoothing along the trials axis in the
epochs image:



.. code-block:: python

    ica.plot_properties(eog_epochs, picks=eog_inds, psd_args={'fmax': 35.},
                        image_args={'sigma': 1.})




.. image:: /auto_tutorials/images/sphx_glr_plot_artifacts_correction_ica_009.png
    :align: center




That component is showing a prototypical average vertical EOG time course.

Pay attention to the labels, a customized read-out of the
:attr:`ica.labels_ <mne.preprocessing.ICA.labels_>`



.. code-block:: python

    print(ica.labels_)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out::

    {u'eog/0/EOG 061': [3], 'eog': [3]}


These labels were used by the plotters and are added automatically
by artifact detection functions. You can also manually edit them to annotate
components.

Now let's see how we would modify our signals if we removed this component
from the data



.. code-block:: python

    ica.plot_overlay(eog_average, exclude=eog_inds, show=False)
    # red -> before, black -> after. Yes! We remove quite a lot!

    # to definitely register this component as a bad one to be removed
    # there is the ``ica.exclude`` attribute, a simple Python list
    ica.exclude.extend(eog_inds)

    # from now on the ICA will reject this component even if no exclude
    # parameter is passed, and this information will be stored to disk
    # on saving

    # uncomment this for reading and writing
    # ica.save('my-ica.fif')
    # ica = read_ica('my-ica.fif')

What if we don't have an EOG channel?
-------------------------------------

We could either:

1. make a bipolar reference from frontal EEG sensors and use as virtual EOG
   channel. This can be tricky though as you can only hope that the frontal
   EEG channels only reflect EOG and not brain dynamics in the prefrontal
   cortex.
2. go for a semi-automated approach, using template matching.

In MNE-Python option 2 is easily achievable and it might give better results,
so let's have a look at it.



.. code-block:: python


    from mne.preprocessing.ica import corrmap  # noqa







The idea behind corrmap is that artefact patterns are similar across subjects
and can thus be identified by correlating the different patterns resulting
from each solution with a template. The procedure is therefore
semi-automatic. :func:`mne.preprocessing.corrmap` hence takes a list of
ICA solutions and a template, that can be an index or an array.

As we don't have different subjects or runs available today, here we will
simulate ICA solutions from different subjects by fitting ICA models to
different parts of the same recording. Then we will use one of the components
from our original ICA as a template in order to detect sufficiently similar
components in the simulated ICAs.

The following block of code simulates having ICA solutions from different
runs/subjects so it should not be used in real analysis - use independent
data sets instead.



.. code-block:: python


    # We'll start by simulating a group of subjects or runs from a subject
    start, stop = [0, len(raw.times) - 1]
    intervals = np.linspace(start, stop, 4, dtype=int)
    icas_from_other_data = list()
    raw.pick_types(meg=True, eeg=False)  # take only MEG channels
    for ii, start in enumerate(intervals):
        if ii + 1 < len(intervals):
            stop = intervals[ii + 1]
            print('fitting ICA from {0} to {1} seconds'.format(start, stop))
            this_ica = ICA(n_components=n_components, method=method).fit(
                raw, start=start, stop=stop, reject=reject)
            icas_from_other_data.append(this_ica)

Remember, don't do this at home! Start by reading in a collection of ICA
solutions instead. Something like:

``icas = [mne.preprocessing.read_ica(fname) for fname in ica_fnames]``



.. code-block:: python

    print(icas_from_other_data)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

We use our original ICA as reference.



.. code-block:: python

    reference_ica = ica







Investigate our reference ICA:



.. code-block:: python

    reference_ica.plot_components()




.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-horizontal

    *

      .. image:: /auto_tutorials/images/sphx_glr_plot_artifacts_correction_ica_015.png
            :scale: 47




Which one is the bad EOG component?
Here we rely on our previous detection algorithm. You would need to decide
yourself if no automatic detection was available.



.. code-block:: python

    reference_ica.plot_sources(eog_average, exclude=eog_inds)




.. image:: /auto_tutorials/images/sphx_glr_plot_artifacts_correction_ica_016.png
    :align: center




Indeed it looks like an EOG, also in the average time course.

We construct a list where our reference run is the first element. Then we
can detect similar components from the other runs using
:func:`mne.preprocessing.corrmap`. So our template must be a tuple like
(reference_run_index, component_index):



.. code-block:: python

    icas = [reference_ica] + icas_from_other_data
    template = (0, eog_inds[0])







Now we can do the corrmap.



.. code-block:: python

    fig_template, fig_detected = corrmap(icas, template=template, label="blinks",
                                         show=True, threshold=.8, ch_type='mag')

Nice, we have found similar ICs from the other (simulated) runs!
This is even nicer if we have 20 or 100 ICA solutions in a list.

You can also use SSP to correct for artifacts. It is a bit simpler and
faster but also less precise than ICA and requires that you know the event
timing of your artifact.
