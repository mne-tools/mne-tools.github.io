This tutorial focuses on visualization of epoched data. All of the functions
introduced here are basically high level matplotlib functions with built in
intelligence to work with epoched data. All the methods return a handle to
matplotlib figure instance.

Events used for constructing the epochs here are the triggers for subject
being presented a smiley face at the center of the visual field. More of the
paradigm at :ref:`BABDHIFJ`.

All plotting functions start with ``plot``. Let's start with the most
obvious. :func:`mne.Epochs.plot` offers an interactive browser that allows
rejection by hand when called in combination with a keyword ``block=True``.
This blocks the execution of the script until the browser window is closed.



.. code-block:: python

    epochs.plot(block=True)

The numbers at the top refer to the event id of the epoch. The number at the
bottom is the running numbering for the epochs.

Since we did no artifact correction or rejection, there are epochs
contaminated with blinks and saccades. For instance, epoch number 1 seems to
be contaminated by a blink (scroll to the bottom to view the EOG channel).
This epoch can be marked for rejection by clicking on top of the browser
window. The epoch should turn red when you click it. This means that it will
be dropped as the browser window is closed.

It is possible to plot event markers on epoched data by passing ``events``
keyword to the epochs plotter. The events are plotted as vertical lines and
they follow the same coloring scheme as :func:`mne.viz.plot_events`. The
events plotter gives you all the events with a rough idea of the timing.
Since the colors are the same, the event plotter can also function as a
legend for the epochs plotter events. It is also possible to pass your own
colors via ``event_colors`` keyword. Here we can plot the reaction times
between seeing the smiley face and the button press (event 32).

When events are passed, the epoch numbering at the bottom is switched off by
default to avoid overlaps. You can turn it back on via settings dialog by
pressing `o` key. You should check out `help` at the lower left corner of the
window for more information about the interactive features.



.. code-block:: python

    events = mne.pick_events(events, include=[5, 32])
    mne.viz.plot_events(events)
    epochs['smiley'].plot(events=events)

To plot individual channels as an image, where you see all the epochs at one
glance, you can use function :func:`mne.Epochs.plot_image`. It shows the
amplitude of the signal over all the epochs plus an average (evoked response)
of the activation. We explicitly set interactive colorbar on (it is also on
by default for plotting functions with a colorbar except the topo plots). In
interactive mode you can scale and change the colormap with mouse scroll and
up/down arrow keys. You can also drag the colorbar with left/right mouse
button. Hitting space bar resets the scale.

You also have functions for plotting channelwise information arranged into a
shape of the channel array. The image plotting uses automatic scaling by
default, but noisy channels and different channel types can cause the scaling
to be a bit off. Here we define the limits by hand.
