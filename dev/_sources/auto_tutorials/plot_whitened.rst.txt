Plotting whitened data
======================

This tutorial demonstrates how to plot whitened evoked data.

Data are whitened for many processes, including dipole fitting, source
localization and some decoding algorithms. Viewing whitened data thus gives
a different perspective on the data that these algorithms operate on.

Let's start by loading some data and computing a signal (spatial) covariance
that we'll consider to be noise.


.. code-block:: python


    import mne
    from mne.datasets import sample







Raw data with whitening
-----------------------
.. note:: In the :meth:`mne.io.Raw.plot` with ``noise_cov`` supplied,
          you can press they "w" key to turn whitening on and off.


.. code-block:: python


    data_path = sample.data_path()
    raw_fname = data_path + '/MEG/sample/sample_audvis_filt-0-40_raw.fif'
    raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif(raw_fname, preload=True)

    events = mne.find_events(raw, stim_channel='STI 014')
    event_id = {'auditory/left': 1, 'auditory/right': 2, 'visual/left': 3,
                'visual/right': 4, 'smiley': 5, 'button': 32}
    reject = dict(grad=4000e-13, mag=4e-12, eog=150e-6)
    epochs = mne.Epochs(raw, events, event_id=event_id, reject=reject)

    # baseline noise cov, not a lot of samples
    noise_cov = mne.compute_covariance(epochs, tmax=0., method='shrunk', rank=None,
                                       verbose='error')

    # butterfly mode shows the differences most clearly
    raw.plot(events=events, butterfly=True)
    raw.plot(noise_cov=noise_cov, events=events, butterfly=True)

Evoked data with scaled whitening
---------------------------------
The :meth:`mne.Evoked.plot_white` function takes an additional step of
scaling the whitened plots to show how well the assumption of Gaussian
noise is satisfied by the data:

    evoked.plot_white(noise_cov=noise_cov, time_unit='s')
