.. _marking_bad_channels:

Marking bad channels
--------------------

Sometimes some MEG or EEG channels are not functioning properly
for various reasons. These channels should be excluded from
analysis by marking them bad as. This is done by setting the 'bads'
in the measurement info of a data container object (e.g. Raw, Epochs,
Evoked). The info['bads'] value is a Python string. Here is
example:



.. code-block:: python


    raw.info['bads'] = ['MEG 2443']







**Why setting a channel bad?**: If a channel does not show
a signal at all (flat) it is important to exclude it from the
analysis. If a channel as a noise level significantly higher than the
other channels it should be marked as bad. Presence of bad channels
can have terribe consequences on down stream analysis. For a flat channel
some noise estimate will be unrealistically low and
thus the current estimate calculations will give a strong weight
to the zero signal on the flat channels and will essentially vanish.
Noisy channels can also affect others when signal-space projections
or EEG average electrode reference is employed. Noisy bad channels can
also adversely affect averaging and noise-covariance matrix estimation by
causing unnecessary rejections of epochs.

Recommended ways to identify bad channels are:

- Observe the quality of data during data
  acquisition and make notes of observed malfunctioning channels to
  your measurement protocol sheet.

- View the on-line averages and check the condition of the channels.

- Compute preliminary off-line averages with artifact rejection,
  SSP/ICA, and EEG average electrode reference computation
  off and check the condition of the channels.

- View raw data with :func:`mne.io.Raw.plot` without SSP/ICA
  enabled and identify bad channels.

.. note::
    Setting the bad channels should be done as early as possible in the
    analysis pipeline. That's why it's recommended to set bad channels
    the raw objects/files. If present in the raw data
    files, the bad channel selections will be automatically transferred
    to averaged files, noise-covariance matrices, forward solution
    files, and inverse operator decompositions.

The actual removal happens using :func:`pick_types <mne.pick_types>` with
`exclude='bads'` option (see :ref:`picking_channels`).


Instead of removing the bad channels, you can also try to repair them.
This is done by **interpolation** of the data from other channels.
To illustrate how to use channel interpolation let us load some data.



.. code-block:: python


    # Reading data with a bad channel marked as bad:
    fname = data_path + '/MEG/sample/sample_audvis-ave.fif'
    evoked = mne.read_evokeds(fname, condition='Left Auditory',
                              baseline=(None, 0))

    # restrict the evoked to EEG and MEG channels
    evoked.pick_types(meg=True, eeg=True, exclude=[])

    # plot with bads
    evoked.plot(exclude=[])

    print(evoked.info['bads'])

    Interpolation is a linear operation that can be performed also on
    Raw and Epochs objects.

For more details on interpolation see the page :ref:`channel_interpolation`.


.. _marking_bad_segments:

Marking bad raw segments with annotations
-----------------------------------------

MNE provides an :class:`mne.Annotations` class that can be used to mark
segments of raw data and to reject epochs that overlap with bad segments
of data. The annotations are automatically synchronized with raw data as
long as the timestamps of raw data and annotations are in sync.

See :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_tutorials_plot_brainstorm_auditory.py`
for a long example exploiting the annotations for artifact removal.

The instances of annotations are created by providing a list of onsets and
offsets with descriptions for each segment. The onsets and offsets are marked
as seconds. ``onset`` refers to time from start of the data. ``offset`` is
the duration of the annotation. The instance of :class:`mne.Annotations`
can be added as an attribute of :class:`mne.io.Raw`.



.. code-block:: python


    eog_events = mne.preprocessing.find_eog_events(raw)
    n_blinks = len(eog_events)
    # Center to cover the whole blink with full duration of 0.5s:
    onset = eog_events[:, 0] / raw.info['sfreq'] - 0.25
    duration = np.repeat(0.5, n_blinks)
    raw.annotations = mne.Annotations(onset, duration, ['bad blink'] * n_blinks,
                                      orig_time=raw.info['meas_date'])
    raw.plot(events=eog_events)  # To see the annotated segments.

    Number of EOG events detected : 46


It is also possible to draw bad segments interactively using
:meth:`raw.plot <mne.io.Raw.plot>` (see :ref:`tut_viz_raw`).

As the data is epoched, all the epochs overlapping with segments whose
description starts with 'bad' are rejected by default. To turn rejection off,
use keyword argument ``reject_by_annotation=False`` when constructing
:class:`mne.Epochs`. When working with neuromag data, the ``first_samp``
offset of raw acquisition is also taken into account the same way as with
event lists. For more see :class:`mne.Epochs` and :class:`mne.Annotations`.


.. _rejecting_bad_epochs:

Rejecting bad epochs
--------------------

When working with segmented data (Epochs) MNE offers a quite simple approach
to automatically reject/ignore bad epochs. This is done by defining
thresholds for peak-to-peak amplitude and flat signal detection.

In the following code we build Epochs from Raw object. One of the provided
parameter is named *reject*. It is a dictionary where every key is a
channel type as a sring and the corresponding values are peak-to-peak
rejection parameters (amplitude ranges as floats). Below we define
the peak-to-peak rejection values for gradiometers,
magnetometers and EOG:



.. code-block:: python


    reject = dict(grad=4000e-13, mag=4e-12, eog=150e-6)







.. note::
   The rejection values can be highly data dependent. You should be careful
   when adjusting these values. Make sure not too many epochs are rejected
   and look into the cause of the rejections. Maybe it's just a matter
   of marking a single channel as bad and you'll be able to save a lot
   of data.


We then construct the epochs



.. code-block:: python

    events = mne.find_events(raw, stim_channel='STI 014')
    event_id = {"auditory/left": 1}
    tmin = -0.2  # start of each epoch (200ms before the trigger)
    tmax = 0.5  # end of each epoch (500ms after the trigger)
    baseline = (None, 0)  # means from the first instant to t = 0
    picks_meg = mne.pick_types(raw.info, meg=True, eeg=False, eog=True,
                               stim=False, exclude='bads')
    epochs = mne.Epochs(raw, events, event_id, tmin, tmax, proj=True,
                        picks=picks_meg, baseline=baseline, reject=reject,
                        reject_by_annotation=True)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out::

    319 events found
    Events id: [ 1  2  3  4  5 32]
    72 matching events found
    Created an SSP operator (subspace dimension = 3)
    4 projection items activated


We then drop/reject the bad epochs



.. code-block:: python

    epochs.drop_bad()





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out::

    Loading data for 72 events and 106 original time points ...
        Rejecting  epoch based on EOG : [u'EOG 061']
        Rejecting  epoch based on MAG : [u'MEG 1711']
    22 bad epochs dropped


And plot the so-called *drop log* that details the reason for which some
epochs have been dropped.



.. code-block:: python


    print(epochs.drop_log[40:45])  # only a subset
    epochs.plot_drop_log()




.. image:: /auto_tutorials/images/sphx_glr_plot_artifacts_correction_rejection_004.png
    :align: center


.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out::

    [['bad blink'], ['IGNORED'], ['IGNORED'], ['IGNORED'], ['bad blink']]


What you see is that some drop log values are empty. It means event was kept.
If it says 'IGNORED' is means the event_id did not contain the associated
event. If it gives the name of channel such as 'EOG 061' it means the
epoch was rejected because 'EOG 061' exceeded the peak-to-peak rejection
limit.
