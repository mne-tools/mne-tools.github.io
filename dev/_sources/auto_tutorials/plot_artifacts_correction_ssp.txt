Apply SSP projections
---------------------

MNE is handling projections at the level of the info,
so to register them populate the list that you find in the 'proj' field



.. code-block:: python


    raw.info['projs'] += eog_projs + ecg_projs







Yes this was it. Now MNE will apply the projs on demand at any later stage,
so watch out for proj parmeters in functions or to it explicitly
with the ``.apply_proj`` method


Demonstrate SSP cleaning on some evoked data
--------------------------------------------



.. code-block:: python


    events = mne.find_events(raw, stim_channel='STI 014')
    reject = dict(grad=4000e-13, mag=4e-12, eog=150e-6)
    # this can be highly data dependent
    event_id = {'auditory/left': 1}

    epochs_no_proj = mne.Epochs(raw, events, event_id, tmin=-0.2, tmax=0.5,
                                proj=False, baseline=(None, 0), reject=reject)
    epochs_no_proj.average().plot(spatial_colors=True)


    epochs_proj = mne.Epochs(raw, events, event_id, tmin=-0.2, tmax=0.5, proj=True,

Looks cool right? It is however often not clear how many components you
should take and unfortunately this can have bad consequences as can be seen
interactively using the delayed SSP mode:



.. code-block:: python


    evoked = mne.Epochs(raw, events, event_id, tmin=-0.2, tmax=0.5,
                        proj='delayed', baseline=(None, 0),
                        reject=reject).average()

    # set time instants in seconds (from 50 to 150ms in a step of 10ms)
    times = np.arange(0.05, 0.15, 0.01)

    evoked.plot_topomap(times, proj='interactive')

    Disabling interactive colorbar for multiple axes. Turn interactivity on explicitly by passing cmap as a tuple.


now you should see checkboxes. Remove a few SSP and see how the auditory
pattern suddenly drops off
