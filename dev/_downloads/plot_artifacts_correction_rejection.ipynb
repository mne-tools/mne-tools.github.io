        "**Why setting a channel bad?**: If a channel does not show\na signal at all (flat) it is important to exclude it from the\nanalysis. If a channel as a noise level significantly higher than the\nother channels it should be marked as bad. Presence of bad channels\ncan have terribe consequences on down stream analysis. For a flat channel\nsome noise estimate will be unrealistically low and\nthus the current estimate calculations will give a strong weight\nto the zero signal on the flat channels and will essentially vanish.\nNoisy channels can also affect others when signal-space projections\nor EEG average electrode reference is employed. Noisy bad channels can\nalso adversely affect averaging and noise-covariance matrix estimation by\ncausing unnecessary rejections of epochs.\n\nRecommended ways to identify bad channels are:\n\n- Observe the quality of data during data\n  acquisition and make notes of observed malfunctioning channels to\n  your measurement protocol sheet.\n\n- View the on-line averages and check the condition of the channels.\n\n- Compute preliminary off-line averages with artifact rejection,\n  SSP/ICA, and EEG average electrode reference computation\n  off and check the condition of the channels.\n\n- View raw data with :func:`mne.io.Raw.plot` without SSP/ICA\n  enabled and identify bad channels.\n\n.. note::\n    Setting the bad channels should be done as early as possible in the\n    analysis pipeline. That's why it's recommended to set bad channels\n    the raw objects/files. If present in the raw data\n    files, the bad channel selections will be automatically transferred\n    to averaged files, noise-covariance matrices, forward solution\n    files, and inverse operator decompositions.\n\nThe actual removal happens using :func:`pick_types <mne.pick_types>` with\n`exclude='bads'` option (see :ref:`picking_channels`).\n"
