        "That's it! You are ready to continue with your analysis pipeline (e.g.\nrunning :func:`mne.make_bem_model`).\n\n#### What if you still get an error?\n\nWhen editing BEM surfaces/meshes in Blender, make sure to use\ntools that do not change the number or order of vertices, or the geometry\nof triangular faces. For example, avoid the extrusion tool, because it\nduplicates the extruded vertices.\n\nBelow are some examples of errors you might encounter when running the\n`mne.make_bem_model` function, and the likely causes of those errors.\n\n\n1. Cannot decimate to requested ico grade\n\n   This error is caused by having too few or too many vertices. The full\n   error is something like:\n\n   .. code-block:: console\n\n      RuntimeError: Cannot decimate to requested ico grade 4. The provided\n      BEM surface has 20516 triangles, which cannot be isomorphic with a\n      subdivided icosahedron. Consider manually decimating the surface to a\n      suitable density and then use ico=None in make_bem_model.\n\n2. Surface inner skull has topological defects\n\n   This error can occur when trying to match the original number of\n   triangles by removing vertices. The full error looks like:\n\n   .. code-block:: console\n\n      RuntimeError: Surface inner skull has topological defects: 12 / 20484\n      vertices have fewer than three neighboring triangles [733, 1014, 2068,\n      7732, 8435, 8489, 10181, 11120, 11121, 11122, 11304, 11788]\n\n3. Surface inner skull is not complete\n\n   This error (like the previous error) reflects a problem with the surface\n   topology (i.e., the expected pattern of vertices/edges/faces is\n   disrupted).\n\n   .. code-block:: console\n\n      RuntimeError: Surface inner skull is not complete (sum of solid\n      angles yielded 0.999668, should be 1.)\n\n4. Triangle ordering is wrong\n\n   This error reflects a mismatch between how the surface is represented in\n   memory (the order of the vertex/face definitions) and what is expected by\n   MNE-Python.  The full error is:\n\n   .. code-block:: console\n\n      RuntimeError: The source surface has a matching number of\n      triangles but ordering is wrong\n\n\nFor any of these errors, it is usually easiest to start over with the\nunedited BEM surface and try again, making sure to only *move* vertices and\nfaces without *adding* or *deleting* any. For example,\nselect a circle of vertices, then press :kbd:`G` to drag them to the desired\nlocation. Smoothing a group of selected vertices in Blender (by\nright-clicking and selecting \"Smooth Vertices\") can also be helpful.\n\n"
