        "\n\n# Background information on filtering\n\n\nHere we give some background information on filtering in general,\nand how it is done in MNE-Python in particular.\nRecommended reading for practical applications of digital\nfilter design can be found in Parks & Burrus [1]_ and\nIfeachor and Jervis [2]_, and for filtering in an\nM/EEG context we recommend reading Widmann *et al.* 2015 [7]_.\nTo see how to use the default filters in MNE-Python on actual data, see\nthe `tut_artifacts_filter` tutorial.\n\nProblem statement\n=================\n\nThe practical issues with filtering electrophysiological data are covered\nwell by Widmann *et al.* in [7]_, in a follow-up to an article where they\nconclude with this statement:\n\n    Filtering can result in considerable distortions of the time course\n    (and amplitude) of a signal as demonstrated by VanRullen (2011) [[3]_].\n    Thus, filtering should not be used lightly. However, if effects of\n    filtering are cautiously considered and filter artifacts are minimized,\n    a valid interpretation of the temporal dynamics of filtered\n    electrophysiological data is possible and signals missed otherwise\n    can be detected with filtering.\n\nIn other words, filtering can increase SNR, but if it is not used carefully,\nit can distort data. Here we hope to cover some filtering basics so\nusers can better understand filtering tradeoffs, and why MNE-Python has\nchosen particular defaults.\n\n\nFiltering basics\n================\n\nLet's get some of the basic math down. In the frequency domain, digital\nfilters have a transfer function that is given by:\n\n\\begin{align}H(z) &= \\frac{b_0 + b_1 z^{-1} + b_2 z^{-2} + ... + b_M z^{-M}}\n                 {1 + a_1 z^{-1} + a_2 z^{-2} + ... + a_N z^{-M}} \\\\\n         &= \\frac{\\sum_0^Mb_kz^{-k}}{\\sum_1^Na_kz^{-k}}\\end{align}\n\nIn the time domain, the numerator coefficients $b_k$ and denominator\ncoefficients $a_k$ can be used to obtain our output data\n$y(n)$ in terms of our input data $x(n)$ as:\n\n\\begin{align}:label: summations\n\n    y(n) &= b_0 x(n) + b_1 x(n-1) + ... + b_M x(n-M)\n            - a_1 y(n-1) - a_2 y(n - 2) - ... - a_N y(n - N)\\\\\n         &= \\sum_0^M b_k x(n-k) - \\sum_1^N a_k y(n-k)\\end{align}\n\nIn other words, the output at time $n$ is determined by a sum over:\n\n    1. The numerator coefficients $b_k$, which get multiplied by\n       the previous input $x(n-k)$ values, and\n    2. The denominator coefficients $a_k$, which get multiplied by\n       the previous output $y(n-k)$ values.\n\nNote that these summations in :eq:`summations` correspond nicely to\n(1) a weighted `moving average`_ and (2) an autoregression_.\n\nFilters are broken into two classes: FIR_ (finite impulse response) and\nIIR_ (infinite impulse response) based on these coefficients.\nFIR filters use a finite number of numerator\ncoefficients $b_k$ ($\\forall k, a_k=0$), and thus each output\nvalue of $y(n)$ depends only on the $M$ previous input values.\nIIR filters depend on the previous input and output values, and thus can have\neffectively infinite impulse responses.\n\nAs outlined in [1]_, FIR and IIR have different tradeoffs:\n\n    * A causal FIR filter can be linear-phase -- i.e., the same time delay\n      across all frequencies -- whereas a causal IIR filter cannot. The phase\n      and group delay characteristics are also usually better for FIR filters.\n    * IIR filters can generally have a steeper cutoff than an FIR filter of\n      equivalent order.\n    * IIR filters are generally less numerically stable, in part due to\n      accumulating error (due to its recursive calculations).\n\nIn MNE-Python we default to using FIR filtering. As noted in Widmann *et al.*\n2015 [7]_:\n\n    Despite IIR filters often being considered as computationally more\n    efficient, they are recommended only when high throughput and sharp\n    cutoffs are required (Ifeachor and Jervis, 2002 [2]_, p. 321),\n    ...FIR filters are easier to control, are always stable, have a\n    well-defined passband, can be corrected to zero-phase without\n    additional computations, and can be converted to minimum-phase.\n    We therefore recommend FIR filters for most purposes in\n    electrophysiological data analysis.\n\nWhen designing a filter (FIR or IIR), there are always tradeoffs that\nneed to be considered, including but not limited to:\n\n    1. Ripple in the pass-band\n    2. Attenuation of the stop-band\n    3. Steepness of roll-off\n    4. Filter order (i.e., length for FIR filters)\n    5. Time-domain ringing\n\nIn general, the sharper something is in frequency, the broader it is in time,\nand vice-versa. This is a fundamental time-frequency tradeoff, and it will\nshow up below.\n\nFIR Filters\n===========\n\nFirst we will focus first on FIR filters, which are the default filters used by\nMNE-Python.\n\n"

Let's look at a few orders of filter,\ni.e., a few different number of coefficients used and therefore steepness\nof the filter:\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Notice that the group delay (which is related to the phase) of\n          the IIR filters below are not constant. In the FIR case, we can\n          design so-called linear-phase filters that have a constant group\n          delay, and thus compensate for the delay (making the filter\n          acausal) if necessary. This cannot be done with IIR filters, as\n          they have a non-linear phase (non-constant group delay). As the\n          filter order increases, the phase distortion near and in the\n          transition band worsens. However, if acausal (forward-backward)\n          filtering can be used, e.g. with :func:`scipy.signal.filtfilt`,\n          these phase issues can theoretically be mitigated.</p></div>\n\n"

        "Some pitfalls of filtering\n==========================\n\nMultiple recent papers have noted potential risks of drawing\nerrant inferences due to misapplication of filters.\n\nLow-pass problems\n-----------------\n\nFilters in general, especially those that are acausal (zero-phase), can make\nactivity appear to occur earlier or later than it truly did. As\nmentioned in VanRullen 2011 [3]_, investigations of commonly (at the time)\nused low-pass filters created artifacts when they were applied to smulated\ndata. However, such deleterious effects were minimal in many real-world\nexamples in Rousselet 2012 [5]_.\n\nPerhaps more revealing, it was noted in Widmann & Schr\u00f6ger 2012 [6]_ that\nthe problematic low-pass filters from VanRullen 2011 [3]_:\n\n   1. Used a least-squares design (like :func:`scipy.signal.firls`) that\n      included \"do-not-care\" transition regions, which can lead to\n      uncontrolled behavior.\n   2. Had a filter length that was independent of the transition bandwidth,\n      which can cause excessive ringing and signal distortion.\n\n\nHigh-pass problems\n------------------\n\nWhen it comes to high-pass filtering, using corner frequencies above 0.1 Hz\nwere found in Acunzo *et al.* 2012 [4]_ to:\n\n   \"...generate a systematic bias easily leading to misinterpretations of\n   neural activity.\u201d\n\nIn a related paper, Widmann *et al.* 2015 [7]_ also came to suggest a 0.1 Hz\nhighpass. And more evidence followed in Tanner *et al.* 2015 [8]_ of such\ndistortions. Using data from language ERP studies of semantic and syntactic\nprocessing (i.e., N400 and P600), using a high-pass above 0.3 Hz caused\nsignificant effects to be introduced implausibly early when compared to the\nunfiltered data. From this, the authors suggested the optimal high-pass\nvalue for language processing to be 0.1 Hz.\n\nWe can recreate a problematic simulation from Tanner *et al.* 2015 [8]_:\n\n   \"The simulated component is a single-cycle cosine wave with an amplitude\n   of 5\u00b5V, onset of 500 ms poststimulus, and duration of 800 ms. The\n   simulated component was embedded in 20 s of zero values to avoid\n   filtering edge effects... Distortions [were] caused by 2 Hz low-pass and\n   high-pass filters... No visible distortion to the original waveform\n   [occurred] with 30 Hz low-pass and 0.01 Hz high-pass filters...\n   Filter frequencies correspond to the half-amplitude (-6 dB) cutoff\n   (12 dB/octave roll-off).\"\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>This simulated signal contains energy not just within the\n          pass-band, but also within the transition and stop-bands -- perhaps\n          most easily understood because the signal has a non-zero DC value,\n          but also because it is a shifted cosine that has been\n          *windowed* (here multiplied by a rectangular window), which\n          makes the cosine and DC frequencies spread to other frequencies\n          (multiplication in time is convolution in frequency, so multiplying\n          by a rectangular window in the time domain means convolving a sinc\n          function with the impulses at DC and the cosine frequency in the\n          frequency domain).</p></div>\n\n\n"

        "Similarly, in a P300 paradigm reported by Kappenman & Luck 2010 [12]_,\nthey found that applying a 1 Hz high-pass decreased the probaility of\nfinding a significant difference in the N100 response, likely because\nthe P300 response was smeared (and inverted) in time by the high-pass\nfilter such that it tended to cancel out the increased N100. However,\nthey nonetheless note that some high-passing can still be useful to deal\nwith drifts in the data.\n\nEven though these papers generally advise a 0.1 HZ or lower frequency for\na high-pass, it is important to keep in mind (as most authors note) that\nfiltering choices should depend on the frequency content of both the\nsignal(s) of interest and the noise to be suppressed. For example, in\nsome of the MNE-Python examples involving `ch_sample_data`,\nhigh-pass values of around 1 Hz are used when looking at auditory\nor visual N100 responses, because we analyze standard (not deviant) trials\nand thus expect that contamination by later or slower components will\nbe limited.\n\nBaseline problems (or solutions?)\n---------------------------------\n\nIn an evolving discussion, Tanner *et al.* 2015 [8]_ suggest using baseline\ncorrection to remove slow drifts in data. However, Maess *et al.* 2016 [9]_\nsuggest that baseline correction, which is a form of high-passing, does\nnot offer substantial advantages over standard high-pass filtering.\nTanner *et al.* [10]_ rebutted that baseline correction can correct for\nproblems with filtering.\n\nTo see what they mean, consider again our old simulated signal ``x`` from\nbefore:\n\n"

        "Both groups seem to acknowledge that the choices of filtering cutoffs, and\nperhaps even the application of baseline correction, depend on the\ncharacteristics of the data being investigated, especially when it comes to:\n\n   1. The frequency content of the underlying evoked activity relative\n      to the filtering parameters.\n   2. The validity of the assumption of no consistent evoked activity\n      in the baseline period.\n\nWe thus recommend carefully applying baseline correction and/or high-pass\nvalues based on the characteristics of the data to be analyzed.\n\n\nFiltering defaults\n==================\n\n\nDefaults in MNE-Python\n----------------------\n\nMost often, filtering in MNE-Python is done at the :class:`mne.io.Raw` level,\nand thus :func:`mne.io.Raw.filter` is used. This function under the hood\n(among other things) calls :func:`mne.filter.filter_data` to actually\nfilter the data, which by default applies a zero-phase FIR filter designed\nusing :func:`scipy.signal.firwin`. In Widmann *et al.* 2015 [7]_, they\nsuggest a specific set of parameters to use for high-pass filtering,\nincluding:\n\n    \"... providing a transition bandwidth of 25% of the lower passband\n    edge but, where possible, not lower than 2 Hz and otherwise the\n    distance from the passband edge to the critical frequency.\u201d\n\nIn practice, this means that for each high-pass value ``l_freq`` or\nlow-pass value ``h_freq`` below, you would get this corresponding\n``l_trans_bandwidth`` or ``h_trans_bandwidth``, respectively,\nif the sample rate were 100 Hz (i.e., Nyquist frequency of 50 Hz):\n\n+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+\n| l_freq or h_freq | l_trans_bandwidth | h_trans_bandwidth |\n+==================+===================+===================+\n|             0.01 |              0.01 |               2.0 |\n+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+\n|              0.1 |               0.1 |               2.0 |\n+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+\n|              1.0 |               1.0 |               2.0 |\n+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+\n|              2.0 |               2.0 |               2.0 |\n+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+\n|              4.0 |               2.0 |               2.0 |\n+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+\n|              8.0 |               2.0 |               2.0 |\n+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+\n|             10.0 |               2.5 |               2.5 |\n+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+\n|             20.0 |               5.0 |               5.0 |\n+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+\n|             40.0 |              10.0 |              10.0 |\n+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+\n|             45.0 |             11.25 |              5.0  |\n+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+\n|             48.0 |              12.0 |              2.0  |\n+------------------+-------------------+-------------------+\n\nMNE-Python has adopted this definition for its high-pass (and low-pass)\ntransition bandwidth choices when using ``l_trans_bandwidth='auto'`` and\n``h_trans_bandwidth='auto'``.\n\nTo choose the filter length automatically with ``filter_length='auto'``,\nthe reciprocal of the shortest transition bandwidth is used to ensure\ndecent attenuation at the stop frequency. Specifically, the reciprocal\n(in samples) is multiplied by 3.1, 3.3, or 5.0 for the Hann, Hamming,\nor Blackman windows, respectively as selected by the ``fir_window``\nargument for ``fir_design='firwin'``, and double these for\n``fir_design='firwin2'`` mode.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>For ``fir_design='firwin2'``, the multiplicative factors are\n          doubled compared to what is given in Ifeachor and Jervis [2]_\n          (p. 357), as :func:`scipy.signal.firwin2` has a smearing effect\n          on the frequency response, which we compensate for by\n          increasing the filter length. This is why\n          ``fir_desgin='firwin'`` is preferred to ``fir_design='firwin2'``.</p></div>\n\nIn 0.14, we default to using a Hamming window in filter design, as it\nprovides up to 53 dB of stop-band attenuation with small pass-band ripple.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>In band-pass applications, often a low-pass filter can operate\n          effectively with fewer samples than the high-pass filter, so\n          it is advisable to apply the high-pass and low-pass separately\n          when using ``fir_design='firwin2'``. For design mode\n          ``fir_design='firwin'``, there is no need to separate the\n          operations, as the lowpass and highpass elements are constructed\n          separately to meet the transition band requirements.</p></div>\n\nFor more information on how to use the\nMNE-Python filtering functions with real data, consult the preprocessing\ntutorial on `tut_artifacts_filter`.\n\nDefaults in MNE-C\n-----------------\nMNE-C by default uses:\n\n   1. 5 Hz transition band for low-pass filters.\n   2. 3-sample transition band for high-pass filters.\n   3. Filter length of 8197 samples.\n\nThe filter is designed in the frequency domain, creating a linear-phase\nfilter such that the delay is compensated for as is done with the MNE-Python\n``phase='zero'`` filtering option.\n\nSquared-cosine ramps are used in the transition regions. Because these\nare used in place of more gradual (e.g., linear) transitions,\na given transition width will result in more temporal ringing but also more\nrapid attenuation than the same transition width in windowed FIR designs.\n\nThe default filter length will generally have excellent attenuation\nbut long ringing for the sample rates typically encountered in M-EEG data\n(e.g. 500-2000 Hz).\n\nDefaults in other software\n--------------------------\nA good but possibly outdated comparison of filtering in various software\npackages is available in [7]_. Briefly:\n\n* EEGLAB\n    MNE-Python in 0.14 defaults to behavior very similar to that of EEGLAB,\n    see the `EEGLAB filtering FAQ`_ for more information.\n* Fieldrip\n    By default FieldTrip applies a forward-backward Butterworth IIR filter\n    of order 4 (band-pass and band-stop filters) or 2 (for low-pass and\n    high-pass filters). Similar filters can be achieved in MNE-Python when\n    filtering with :meth:`raw.filter(..., method='iir') <mne.io.Raw.filter>`\n    (see also :func:`mne.filter.construct_iir_filter` for options).\n    For more inforamtion, see e.g. `FieldTrip band-pass documentation`_.\n\nSummary\n=======\n\nWhen filtering, there are always tradeoffs that should be considered.\nOne important tradeoff is between time-domain characteristics (like ringing)\nand frequency-domain attenuation characteristics (like effective transition\nbandwidth). Filters with sharp frequency cutoffs can produce outputs that\nring for a long time when they operate on signals with frequency content\nin the transition band. In general, therefore, the wider a transition band\nthat can be tolerated, the better behaved the filter will be in the time\ndomain.\n\nReferences\n==========\n\n.. [1] Parks TW, Burrus CS (1987).
