        "\n\n# Importing data from fNIRS devices\n\nMNE includes various functions and utilities for reading NIRS\ndata and optode locations.\n\nfNIRS devices consist of light sources and light detectors. A channel is formed\nby source-detector pairs. MNE stores the location of the channels, sources, and\ndetectors.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-danger\"><h4>Warning</h4><p>Information about device light wavelength is stored in channel\n             names. Manual modification of channel names is not recommended.</p></div>\n\n\n## NIRx (directory)\n\nNIRx recordings can be read in using :func:`mne.io.read_raw_nirx`.\nThe NIRx device stores data directly to a directory with multiple file types,\nMNE extracts the appropriate information from each file.\nMNE only supports NIRx files recorded with NIRStar version 15.0 and above.\n\n\n\n## SNIRF (.snirf)\n\nData stored in the SNIRF format can be read in\nusing :func:`mne.io.read_raw_snirf`.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-danger\"><h4>Warning</h4><p>The SNIRF format has provisions for many different types of NIRS\n             recordings. MNE currently only supports continuous wave data\n             stored in the .snirf format.</p></div>\n\n\n\n## BOXY (.txt)\n\nBOXY recordings can be read in using :func:`mne.io.read_raw_boxy`.\nThe BOXY software and ISS Imagent I and II devices are frequency domain\nsystems that store data in a single ``.txt`` file containing what they call\n(with MNE's name for that type of data in parens):\n\n- DC\n    All light collected by the detector (``fnirs_cw_amplitude``)\n- AC\n    High-frequency modulated light intensity (``fnirs_fd_ac_amplitude``)\n- Phase\n    Phase of the modulated light (``fnirs_fd_phase``)\n\nDC data is stored as the type ``fnirs_cw_amplitude`` because it\ncollects both the modulated and any unmodulated light, and hence is analogous\nto what is collected by continuous wave systems such as NIRx. This helps with\nconformance to SNIRF standard types.\n\nThese raw data files can be saved by the acquisition devices as parsed or\nunparsed ``.txt`` files, which affects how the data in the file is organised.\nMNE will read either file type and extract the raw DC, AC, and Phase data.\nIf triggers are sent using the ``digaux`` port of the recording hardware, MNE\nwill also read the ``digaux`` data and create annotations for any triggers.\n\n## Hitachi (.csv)\n\nHitachi fNIRS recordings can be read using :func:`mne.io.read_raw_hitachi`.\nNo electrode information is stored so you'll need to set the montage manually,\nsee the Notes section of :func:`mne.io.read_raw_hitachi`.\n\n## Loading legacy data in CSV or TSV format\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-danger\"><h4>Warning</h4><p>This method is not supported and users are discoraged to use it.\n             You should convert your data to the\n             `SNIRF <https://github.com/fNIRS/snirf>`_ format using the tools\n             provided by the Society for functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy,\n             and then load it using :func:`mne.io.read_raw_snirf`.</p></div>\n\nfNIRS measurements can have a non-standardised format that is not supported by\nMNE and cannot be converted easily into SNIRF. This legacy data is often in CSV\nor TSV format, we show here a way to load it even though it is not officially\nsupported by MNE due to the lack of standardisation of the file format (the\nnaming and ordering of channels, the type and scaling of data, and\nspecification of sensor positions varies between each vendor). You will likely\nhave to adapt this depending on the system from which your CSV originated.\n"
