        "The channels are color coded by channel type. Generally MEG channels are\ncolored in different shades of blue, whereas EEG channels are black. The\nscrollbar on right side of the browser window also tells us that two of the\nchannels are marked as ``bad``. Bad channels are color coded gray. By\nclicking the lines or channel names on the left, you can mark or unmark a bad\nchannel interactively. You can use +/- keys to adjust the scale (also = works\nfor magnifying the data). Note that the initial scaling factors can be set\nwith parameter ``scalings``. If you don't know the scaling factor for\nchannels, you can automatically set them by passing scalings='auto'. With\n``pageup/pagedown`` and ``home/end`` keys you can adjust the amount of data\nviewed at once. To see all the interactive features, hit ``?`` or click\n``help`` in the lower left corner of the browser window.\n\nThe channels are sorted by channel type by default. You can use the ``order``\nparameter of :func:`raw.plot <mne.io.Raw.plot>` to group the channels in a\ndifferent way. ``order='selection'`` uses the same channel groups as MNE-C's\nmne_browse_raw (see :ref:`CACCJEJD`). The selections are defined in\n``mne-python/mne/data/mne_analyze.sel`` and by modifying the channels there,\nyou can define your own selection groups. Notice that this also affects the\nselections returned by :func:`mne.read_selection`. By default the selections\nonly work for Neuromag data, but ``order='position'`` tries to mimic this\nbehavior for any data with sensor positions available. The channels are\ngrouped by sensor positions to 8 evenly sized regions. Notice that for this\nto work effectively, all the data channels in the channel array must be\npresent. The ``order`` parameter can also be passed as an array of ints\n(picks) to plot the channels in the given order.\n\n"
