        "The channels are color coded by channel type. Generally MEG channels are\ncolored in different shades of blue, whereas EEG channels are black. The\nscrollbar on right side of the browser window also tells us that two of the\nchannels are marked as ``bad``. Bad channels are color coded gray. By\nclicking the lines or channel names on the left, you can mark or unmark a bad\nchannel interactively. You can use +/- keys to adjust the scale (also = works\nfor magnifying the data). Note that the initial scaling factors can be set\nwith parameter ``scalings``. If you don't know the scaling factor for\nchannels, you can automatically set them by passing scalings='auto'. With\n``pageup/pagedown`` and ``home/end`` keys you can adjust the amount of data\nviewed at once.\n\nDrawing annotations\n-------------------\n\nYou can enter annotation mode by pressing ``a`` key. In annotation mode you\ncan mark segments of data (and modify existing annotations) with the left\nmouse button. You can use the description of any existing annotation or\ncreate a new description by typing when the annotation dialog is active.\nNotice that the description starting with the keyword ``'bad'`` means that\nthe segment will be discarded when epoching the data. Existing annotations\ncan be deleted with the right mouse button.  Annotation mode is exited by\npressing ``a`` again or closing the annotation window. See also\n:class:`mne.Annotations` and `marking_bad_segments`. To see all the\ninteractive features, hit ``?`` key or click ``help`` in the lower left\ncorner of the browser window.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-danger\"><h4>Warning</h4><p>Annotations are modified in-place immediately at run-time.\n             Deleted annotations cannot be retrieved after deletion.</p></div>\n\nThe channels are sorted by channel type by default. You can use the\n``group_by`` parameter of :func:`raw.plot <mne.io.Raw.plot>` to group the\nchannels in a different way. ``group_by='selection'`` uses the same channel\ngroups as MNE-C's mne_browse_raw (see `CACCJEJD`). The selections are\ndefined in ``mne-python/mne/data/mne_analyze.sel`` and by modifying the\nchannels there, you can define your own selection groups. Notice that this\nalso affects the selections returned by :func:`mne.read_selection`. By\ndefault the selections only work for Neuromag data, but\n``group_by='position'`` tries to mimic this behavior for any data with sensor\npositions available. The channels are grouped by sensor positions to 8 evenly\nsized regions. Notice that for this to work effectively, all the data\nchannels in the channel array must be present. The ``order`` parameter allows\nto customize the order and select a subset of channels for plotting (picks).\nHere we use the butterfly mode and group the channels by position. To toggle\nbetween regular and butterfly modes, press 'b' key when the plotter window is\nactive. Notice that ``group_by`` also affects the channel groupings in\nbutterfly mode.\n\n"
