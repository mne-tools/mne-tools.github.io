Keeping track of which Event ID corresponds to which\nexperimental condition can be cumbersome, and it is often desirable to pool\nexperimental conditions during analysis. You may recall that the mapping of\ninteger Event IDs to meaningful descriptions for the `sample dataset\n<sample-dataset>` is given in `this table\n<sample-data-event-dict-table>` in the `introductory tutorial\n<tut-overview>`.

        "Event dictionaries like this one are used when extracting epochs from\ncontinuous data, and the resulting :class:`~mne.Epochs` object allows pooling\nby requesting partial trial descriptors. For example, if we wanted to pool\nall auditory trials, instead of merging Event IDs 1 and 2 using the\n:func:`~mne.merge_events` function, we can make use of the fact that the keys\nof ``event_dict`` contain multiple trial descriptors separated by ``/``\ncharacters: requesting ``'auditory'`` trials will select all epochs with\nEvent IDs 1 and 2; requesting ``'left'`` trials will select all epochs with\nEvent IDs 1 and 3. An example of this is shown later, in the\n`tut-section-subselect-epochs` section of the tutorial\n`tut-epochs-class`.\n\n\n## Plotting events\n\nAnother use of event dictionaries is when plotting events, which can serve as\na useful check that your event signals were properly sent to the STIM\nchannel(s) and that MNE-Python has successfully found them. The function\n:func:`mne.viz.plot_events` will plot each event versus its sample number\n(or, if you provide the sampling frequency, it will plot them versus time in\nseconds). It can also account for the offset between sample number and sample\nindex in Neuromag systems, with the ``first_samp`` parameter.
