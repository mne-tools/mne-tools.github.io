        "## Amplitude and latency measures\nIt is common in ERP research to extract measures of amplitude or latency to\ncompare across different conditions. There are many measures that can be\nextracted from ERPs, and many of these are detailed (including the respective\nstrengths and weaknesses) in chapter 9 of Luck :footcite:`Luck2014` (also see\nthe `Measurement Tool <https://bit.ly/37uydRw>`_ in the ERPLAB Toolbox\n:footcite:`Lopez-CalderonLuck2014`).\n\nThis part of the tutorial will demonstrate how to extract three common\nmeasures:\n\n* Peak latency\n* Peak amplitude\n* Mean amplitude\n\n### Peak latency and amplitude\n\nThe most common measures of amplitude and latency are peak measures.\nPeak measures are basically the maximum amplitude of the signal in a\nspecified time window and the time point (or latency) at which the peak\namplitude occurred.\n\nPeak measures can be obtained using the :meth:`~mne.Evoked.get_peak` method.\nThere are two important things to point out about\n:meth:`~mne.Evoked.get_peak` method. First, it finds the strongest peak\nlooking across **all channels** of the selected type that are available in\nthe :class:`~mne.Evoked` object. As a consequence, if you want to restrict\nthe search for the peak to a group of channels or a single channel, you\nshould first use the :meth:`~mne.Evoked.pick` or\n:meth:`~mne.Evoked.pick_channels` methods. Second, the\n:meth:`~mne.Evoked.get_peak` method can find different types of peaks using\nthe ``mode`` argument. There are three options:\n\n* ``mode='pos'``: finds the peak with a positive voltage (ignores\n  negative voltages)\n* ``mode='neg'``: finds the peak with a negative voltage (ignores\n  positive voltages)\n* ``mode='abs'``: finds the peak with the largest absolute voltage\n  regardless of sign (positive or negative)\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to find the first positive peak in the\nERP (i.e., the P100) for the left visual condition (i.e., the\n``l_vis`` :class:`~mne.Evoked` object). The time window used to search for\nthe peak ranges from .08 to .12 s. This time window was selected because it\nis when P100 typically occurs. Note that all ``'eeg'`` channels are submitted\nto the :meth:`~mne.Evoked.get_peak` method.\n\n"

        "While the peak latencies are the same in channels ``eeg55`` and ``eeg59``,\nthe peak amplitudes differ. This approach can also be applied to virtual\nchannels created with the :func:`~mne.channels.combine_channels` function and\ndifference waves created with the :func:`mne.combine_evoked` function (see\n``aud_minus_vis`` in section `Comparing conditions`_ above).\n\nPeak measures are very susceptible to high frequency noise in the\nsignal (for discussion, see :footcite:`Luck2014`). Specifically, high\nfrequency noise positively bias peak amplitude measures. This bias can\nconfound comparisons across conditions where ERPs differ in the level of high\nfrequency noise, such as when the conditions differ in the number of trials\ncontributing to the ERP. One way to avoid this is to apply a non-causal\nlow-pass filter to the ERP. Low-pass filters reduce the contribution of high\nfrequency noise by smoothing out fast (i.e., high frequency) fluctuations in\nthe signal (see `disc-filtering`). While this can reduce the positive\nbias in peak amplitude measures caused by high frequency noise, low-pass\nfiltering the ERP can introduce challenges in interpreting peak latency\nmeasures for effects of interest :footcite:`Rousselet2012,VanRullen2011`.\n\nIf using peak measures, it is critical to visually inspect the data to\nmake sure the selected time window actually contains a peak\n(:meth:`~mne.Evoked.get_peak` will always identify a peak).\nVisual inspection allows to easily verify whether the automatically found\npeak is correct. The :meth:`~mne.Evoked.get_peak` detects the maximum or\nminimum voltage in the specified time range and returns the latency and\namplitude of this peak. There is no guarantee that this method will return\nan actual peak. Instead, it may return a value on the rising or falling edge\nof the peak we are trying to find.\n\nThe following example demonstrates why visual inspection is crucial. Below,\nwe use a known bad time window (.095 to .135 s) to search for a peak in\nchannel ``eeg59``.\n\n"

        "### Mean Amplitude\n\nAnother common practice in ERP studies is to define a component (or effect)\nas the mean amplitude within a specified time window. One advantage of this\napproach is that it is less sensitive to high frequency noise (compared to\npeak amplitude measures) because averaging over a time window acts like a\nlow-pass filter (see discussion in the above section\n`Peak latency and amplitude`_).\n\nWhen using mean amplitude measures, selecting the time window based on\nthe effect of interest (e.g., the difference between two conditions) can\ninflate the likelihood of finding false positives in your results because\nthis approach is circular :footcite:`LuckGaspelin2017`. There are other, and\nbetter, ways to identify a time window to use for extracting mean amplitude\nmeasures. First, you can use *a priori* time window based on prior research.\nA second way is to define a time window from an independent condition or set\nof trials not used in the analysis (e.g., a \"localizer\"). A third approach is\nto define a time window using the across-condition grand average. This latter\napproach is not circular because the across-condition mean and condition\ndifference are independent of one another. The issues discussed above also\napply to selecting channels used for analysis.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to pull out the mean amplitude\nfrom the left visual condition (i.e., the ``l_vis`` :class:`~mne.Evoked`\nobject) using from selected channels and time windows. Stimulating the\nleft visual field is increases neural activity visual cortex of the\ncontralateral (i.e., right) hemisphere. We can test this by examining the\namplitude of the ERP for left visual field stimulation over right\n(contralateral) and left (ipsilateral) channels. The channels used for this\nanalysis are ``eeg54`` and ``eeg57`` (left hemisphere), and ``eeg59`` and\n``eeg55`` (right hemisphere). The time window used is .08 (``good_tmin``)\nto .12 s (``good_tmax``) as it corresponds to when P100 typically occurs. The\nP100 is sensitive to left and right visual field stimulation. The mean\namplitude is extracted from the above four channels and stored in a\n:class:`pandas.DataFrame`.\n\n"
