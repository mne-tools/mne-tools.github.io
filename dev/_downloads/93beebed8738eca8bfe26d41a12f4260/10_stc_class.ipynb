        "\n\n# The SourceEstimate data structure\n\nSource estimates, commonly referred to as\n:term:`STC (Source Time Courses) <stc>`,\nare obtained from source localization methods.\nSource localization method solve the so-called 'inverse problem'.\nMNE provides different methods for solving it:\ndSPM, sLORETA, LCMV, MxNE etc.\n\nSource localization consists in projecting the EEG/MEG sensor data into\na 3-dimensional 'source space' positioned in the individual subject's brain\nanatomy. Hence the data is transformed such that the recorded time series at\neach sensor location maps to time series at each spatial location of the\n'source space' where is defined our source estimates.\n\nAn STC object contains the amplitudes of the sources over time.\nIt only stores the amplitudes of activations but\nnot the locations of the sources. To get access to the locations\nyou need to have the :class:`source space <mne.SourceSpaces>`\n(often abbreviated ``src``) used to compute the\n:class:`forward operator <mne.Forward>` (often abbreviated ``fwd``).\n\nSee `tut-forward` for more details on forward modeling, and\n`tut-inverse-methods`\nfor an example of source localization with dSPM, sLORETA or eLORETA.\n\nSource estimates come in different forms:\n\n    - :class:`mne.SourceEstimate`: For cortically constrained source spaces.\n\n    - :class:`mne.VolSourceEstimate`: For volumetric source spaces\n\n    - :class:`mne.VectorSourceEstimate`: For cortically constrained source\n      spaces with vector-valued source activations (strength and orientation)\n\n    - :class:`mne.MixedSourceEstimate`: For source spaces formed of a\n      combination of cortically constrained and volumetric sources.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>:class:`(Vector) <mne.VectorSourceEstimate>`\n    :class:`SourceEstimate <mne.SourceEstimate>` are surface representations\n    mostly used together with `FreeSurfer <tut-freesurfer-mne>`\n    surface representations.</p></div>\n\nLet's get ourselves an idea of what a :class:`mne.SourceEstimate` really\nis.

        "Indeed and as the mindful reader already suspected, the same can be said\nabout vertices. ``stc.lh_vertno`` thereby maps to the left and\n``stc.rh_vertno`` to the right inflated surface representation of\nFreeSurfer.\n\n## Relationship to SourceSpaces (src)\n\nAs mentioned above, :class:`src <mne.SourceSpaces>` carries the mapping from\nstc to the surface. The surface is built up from a\n[triangulated mesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_triangulation)\nfor each hemisphere. Each triangle building up a face consists of 3 vertices.\nSince src is a list of two source spaces (left and right hemisphere), we can\naccess the respective data by selecting the source space first. Faces\nbuilding up the left hemisphere can be accessed via ``src[0]['tris']``, where\nthe index $0$ stands for the left and $1$ for the right\nhemisphere.\n\nThe values in src[0]['tris'] refer to row indices in ``src[0]['rr']``.\nHere we find the actual coordinates of the surface mesh. Hence every index\nvalue for vertices will select a coordinate from here. Furthermore\n``src[0]['vertno']`` stores the same data as ``stc.lh_vertno``,\nexcept when working with sparse solvers such as\n:func:`mne.inverse_sparse.mixed_norm`, as then only a fraction of\nvertices actually have non-zero activations.\n\nIn other words ``stc.lh_vertno`` equals ``src[0]['vertno']``, whereas\n``stc.rh_vertno`` equals ``src[1]['vertno']``. Thus the Nth time series in\nstc.lh_data corresponds to the Nth value in stc.lh_vertno and\nsrc[0]['vertno'] respectively, which in turn map the time series to a\nspecific location on the surface, represented as the set of cartesian\ncoordinates ``stc.lh_vertno[N]`` in ``src[0]['rr']``.\n\nLet's obtain the peak amplitude of the data as vertex and time point index\n\n"
