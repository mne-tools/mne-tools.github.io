The ``bads`` field\ngets updated immediately each time you toggle a channel, and will retain its\nmodified state after the plot window is closed.\n\nThe list of bad channels in the :class:`mne.Info` object's ``bads`` field is\nautomatically taken into account in dozens of functions and methods across\nthe MNE-Python codebase. This is done consistently with a parameter\n``exclude='bads'`` in the function or method signature.

        "The bad EEG channel is not so obvious, but the bad gradiometer is easy to\nsee.\n\nRemember, marking bad channels should be done as early as possible in the\nanalysis pipeline. When bad channels are marked in a :class:`~mne.io.Raw`\nobject, the markings will be automatically transferred through the chain of\nderived object types: including :class:`~mne.Epochs` and :class:`~mne.Evoked`\nobjects, but also :class:`noise covariance <mne.Covariance>` objects,\n:class:`forward solution computations <mne.Forward>`, :class:`inverse\noperators <mne.minimum_norm.InverseOperator>`, etc. If you don't notice the\nbadness until later stages of your analysis pipeline, you'll probably need to\ngo back and re-run the pipeline, so it's a good investment of time to\ncarefully explore the data for bad channels early on.\n\n\n### Why mark bad channels at all?\n\nMany analysis computations can be strongly affected by the presence of bad\nchannels. For example, a malfunctioning channel with completely flat signal\nwill have zero channel variance, which will cause noise estimates to be\nunrealistically low. This low noise estimate will lead to a strong channel\nweight in the estimate of cortical current, and because the channel is flat,\nthe magnitude of cortical current estimates will shrink dramatically.\n\nConversely, very noisy channels can also cause problems. For example, they\ncan lead to too many epochs being discarded based on signal amplitude\nrejection thresholds, which in turn can lead to less robust estimation of the\nnoise covariance across sensors. Noisy channels can also interfere with\n:term:`SSP` computations, because the projectors will be\nspatially biased in the direction of the noisy channel, which can cause\nadjacent good channels to be suppressed. ICA is corrupted by noisy channels\nfor similar reasons. On the other hand, when performing machine learning\nanalyses, bad channels may have limited, if any impact (i.e., bad channels\nwill be uninformative and therefore ignored / deweighted by the algorithm).\n\n\n## Interpolating bad channels\n\nIn some cases simply excluding bad channels is sufficient (for example, if\nyou plan only to analyze a specific sensor ROI, and the bad channel is\noutside that ROI). However, in cross-subject analyses it is often helpful to\nmaintain the same data dimensionality for all subjects, and there is no\nguarantee that the same channels will be bad for all subjects. It is possible\nin such cases to remove each channel that is bad for even a single subject,\nbut that can lead to a dramatic drop in data rank (and ends up discarding a\nfair amount of clean data in the process). In such cases it is desirable to\nreconstruct bad channels by interpolating its signal based on the signals of\nthe good sensors around them.\n\n\n### How interpolation works\n\nInterpolation of EEG channels in MNE-Python is done using the spherical\nspline method :footcite:`PerrinEtAl1989`, which projects the sensor\nlocations onto a unit sphere\nand interpolates the signal at the bad sensor locations based on the signals\nat the good locations. Mathematical details are presented in\n`channel-interpolation`. Interpolation of MEG channels uses the field\nmapping algorithms used in computing the `forward solution\n<tut-forward>`.\n\n\n### Interpolation in MNE-Python\n\nInterpolating bad channels in :class:`~mne.io.Raw` objects is done with the\n:meth:`~mne.io.Raw.interpolate_bads` method, which automatically applies the\ncorrect method (spherical splines or field interpolation) to EEG and MEG\nchannels, respectively (there is a corresponding method\n:meth:`mne.Epochs.interpolate_bads` that works for :class:`~mne.Epochs`\nobjects). To illustrate how it works, we'll start by cropping the raw object\nto just three seconds for easier plotting:\n\n"
