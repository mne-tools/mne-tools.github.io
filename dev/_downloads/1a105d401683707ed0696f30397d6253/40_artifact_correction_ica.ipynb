For conceptual background on ICA, see\n`this scikit-learn tutorial\n<sphx_glr_auto_examples_decomposition_plot_ica_blind_source_separation.py>`.\n\nWe begin as always by importing the necessary Python modules and loading some\n`example data <sample-dataset>`.

        "<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Before applying ICA (or any artifact repair strategy), be sure to observe\n    the artifacts in your data to make sure you choose the right repair tool.\n    Sometimes the right tool is no tool at all \u2014 if the artifacts are small\n    enough you may not even need to repair them to get good analysis results.\n    See `tut-artifact-overview` for guidance on detecting and\n    visualizing various types of artifact.</p></div>\n\n## What is ICA?\n\nIndependent components analysis (ICA) is a technique for estimating\nindependent source signals from a set of recordings in which the source\nsignals were mixed together in unknown ratios. A common example of this is\nthe problem of `blind source separation`_: with 3 musical instruments playing\nin the same room, and 3 microphones recording the performance (each picking\nup all 3 instruments, but at varying levels), can you somehow \"unmix\" the\nsignals recorded by the 3 microphones so that you end up with a separate\n\"recording\" isolating the sound of each instrument?\n\nIt is not hard to see how this analogy applies to EEG/MEG analysis: there are\nmany \"microphones\" (sensor channels) simultaneously recording many\n\"instruments\" (blinks, heartbeats, activity in different areas of the brain,\nmuscular activity from jaw clenching or swallowing, etc). As long as these\nvarious source signals are `statistically independent`_ and non-gaussian, it\nis usually possible to separate the sources using ICA, and then re-construct\nthe sensor signals after excluding the sources that are unwanted.\n\n\n### ICA in MNE-Python\n\n.. admonition:: ICA and dimensionality reduction\n    :class: sidebar hint\n\n    If you want to perform ICA with *no* dimensionality reduction (other than\n    the number of Independent Components (ICs) given in ``n_components``, and\n    any subsequent exclusion of ICs you specify in ``ICA.exclude``), simply\n    pass ``n_components``.\n\n    However, if you *do* want to reduce dimensionality, consider this\n    example: if you have 300 sensor channels and you set ``n_components=50``\n    during instantiation and pass ``n_pca_components=None`` to\n    `~mne.preprocessing.ICA.apply`, then the the first 50\n    PCs are sent to the ICA algorithm (yielding 50 ICs), and during\n    reconstruction `~mne.preprocessing.ICA.apply` will use the 50 ICs\n    plus PCs number 51-300 (the full PCA residual). If instead you specify\n    ``n_pca_components=120`` in `~mne.preprocessing.ICA.apply`, it will\n    reconstruct using the 50 ICs plus the first 70 PCs in the PCA residual\n    (numbers 51-120), thus discarding the smallest 180 components.\n\n    **If you have previously been using EEGLAB**'s ``runica()`` and are\n    looking for the equivalent of its ``'pca', n`` option to reduce\n    dimensionality, set ``n_components=n`` during initialization and pass\n    ``n_pca_components=n`` to `~mne.preprocessing.ICA.apply`.\n\nMNE-Python implements three different ICA algorithms: ``fastica`` (the\ndefault), ``picard``, and ``infomax``. FastICA and Infomax are both in fairly\nwidespread use; Picard is a newer (2017) algorithm that is expected to\nconverge faster than FastICA and Infomax, and is more robust than other\nalgorithms in cases where the sources are not completely independent, which\ntypically happens with real EEG/MEG data. See\n:footcite:`AblinEtAl2018` for more information.\n\nThe ICA interface in MNE-Python is similar to the interface in\n`scikit-learn`_: some general parameters are specified when creating an\n`~mne.preprocessing.ICA` object, then the `~mne.preprocessing.ICA` object is\nfit to the data using its `~mne.preprocessing.ICA.fit` method. The results of\nthe fitting are added to the `~mne.preprocessing.ICA` object as attributes\nthat end in an underscore (``_``), such as ``ica.mixing_matrix_`` and\n``ica.unmixing_matrix_``. After fitting, the ICA component(s) that you want\nto remove must be chosen, and the ICA fit must then be applied to the\n`~mne.io.Raw` or `~mne.Epochs` object using the `~mne.preprocessing.ICA`\nobject's `~mne.preprocessing.ICA.apply` method.\n\nAs is typically done with ICA, the data are first scaled to unit variance and\nwhitened using principal components analysis (PCA) before performing the ICA\ndecomposition. This is a two-stage process:\n\n1. To deal with different channel types having different units\n   (e.g., Volts for EEG and Tesla for MEG), data must be pre-whitened.\n   If ``noise_cov=None`` (default), all data of a given channel type is\n   scaled by the standard deviation across all channels. If ``noise_cov`` is\n   a `~mne.Covariance`, the channels are pre-whitened using the covariance.\n2. The pre-whitened data are then decomposed using PCA.\n\nFrom the resulting principal components (PCs), the first ``n_components`` are\nthen passed to the ICA algorithm if ``n_components`` is an integer number.\nIt can also be a float between 0 and 1, specifying the **fraction** of\nexplained variance that the PCs should capture; the appropriate number of\nPCs (i.e., just as many PCs as are required to explain the given fraction\nof total variance) is then passed to the ICA.\n\nAfter visualizing the Independent Components (ICs) and excluding any that\ncapture artifacts you want to repair, the sensor signal can be reconstructed\nusing the `~mne.preprocessing.ICA` object's\n`~mne.preprocessing.ICA.apply` method. By default, signal\nreconstruction uses all of the ICs (less any ICs listed in ``ICA.exclude``)\nplus all of the PCs that were not included in the ICA decomposition (i.e.,\nthe \"PCA residual\"). If you want to reduce the number of components used at\nthe reconstruction stage, it is controlled by the ``n_pca_components``\nparameter (which will in turn reduce the rank of your data; by default\n``n_pca_components=None`` resulting in no additional dimensionality\nreduction). The fitting and reconstruction procedures and the\nparameters that control dimensionality at various stages are summarized in\nthe diagram below:\n\n\n.. raw:: html\n\n   <a href=\n    \"../../_images/graphviz-7483cb1cf41f06e2a4ef451b17f073dbe584ba30.png\">\n\n.. graphviz:: ../../_static/diagrams/ica.dot\n   :alt: Diagram of ICA procedure in MNE-Python\n   :align: left\n\n.. raw:: html\n\n   </a>\n\nSee the Notes section of the `~mne.preprocessing.ICA` documentation\nfor further details. Next we'll walk through an extended example that\nillustrates each of these steps in greater detail.\n\n## Example: EOG and ECG artifact repair\n\n### Visualizing the artifacts\n\nLet's begin by visualizing the artifacts that we want to repair.

A high-pass filter with 1 Hz cutoff frequency is recommended.\nHowever, because filtering is a linear operation, the ICA solution found from\nthe filtered signal can be applied to the unfiltered signal (see\n:footcite:`WinklerEtAl2015` for\nmore information), so we'll keep a copy of the unfiltered\n`~mne.io.Raw` object around so we can apply the ICA solution to it\nlater.\n\n"

This means you can compute ICA on\n    discontinuous `~mne.Epochs` or `~mne.Evoked` objects (not\n    just continuous `~mne.io.Raw` objects), or only use every Nth\n    sample by passing the ``decim`` parameter to ``ICA.fit()``.\n\nNow we're ready to set up and fit the ICA. Since we know (from observing our\nraw data) that the EOG and ECG artifacts are fairly strong, we would expect\nthose artifacts to be captured in the first few dimensions of the PCA\ndecomposition that happens before the ICA. Therefore, we probably don't need\na huge number of components to do a good job of isolating our artifacts\n(though it is usually preferable to include more components for a more\naccurate solution). As a first guess, we'll run ICA with ``n_components=15``\n(use only the first 15 PCA components to compute the ICA decomposition) \u2014 a\nvery small number given that our data has over 300 channels, but with the\nadvantage that it will run quickly and we will able to tell easily whether it\nworked or not (because we already know what the EOG / ECG artifacts should\nlook like).\n\nICA fitting is not deterministic (e.g., the components may get a sign\nflip on different runs, or may not always be returned in the same order), so\nwe'll also specify a `random seed`_ so that we get identical results each\ntime this tutorial is built by our web servers.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-danger\"><h4>Warning</h4><p>`~mne.Epochs` used for fitting ICA should not be\n    baseline-corrected.
