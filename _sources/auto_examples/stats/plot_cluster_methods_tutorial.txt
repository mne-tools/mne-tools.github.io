======================================================
Permutation t-test on toy data with spatial clustering
======================================================

Following the illustrative example of Ridgway et al. 2012,
this demonstrates some basic ideas behind both the "hat"
variance adjustment method, as well as threshold-free
cluster enhancement (TFCE) methods in mne-python.

This toy dataset consists of a 40 x 40 square with a "signal"
present in the center (at pixel [20, 20]) with white noise
added and a 5-pixel-SD normal smoothing kernel applied.

For more information, see:
Ridgway et al. 2012, "The problem of low variance voxels in
statistical parametric mapping; a new hat avoids a 'haircut'",
NeuroImage. 2012 Feb 1;59(3):2131-41.

Smith and Nichols 2009, "Threshold-free cluster enhancement:
addressing problems of smoothing, threshold dependence, and
localisation in cluster inference", NeuroImage 44 (2009) 83-98.

In the top row plot the T statistic over space, peaking toward the
center. Note that it has peaky edges. Second, with the "hat" variance
correction/regularization, the peak becomes correctly centered. Third,
the TFCE approach also corrects for these edge artifacts. Fourth, the
the two methods combined provide a tighter estimate, for better or
worse.

Now considering multiple-comparisons corrected statistics on these
variables, note that a non-cluster test (e.g., FDR or Bonferroni) would
mis-localize the peak due to sharpness in the T statistic driven by
low-variance pixels toward the edge of the plateau. Standard clustering
(first plot in the second row) identifies the correct region, but the
whole area must be declared significant, so no peak analysis can be done.
Also, the peak is broad. In this method, all significances are
family-wise error rate (FWER) corrected, and the method is
non-parametric so assumptions of Gaussian data distributions (which do
actually hold for this example) don't need to be satisfied. Adding the
"hat" technique tightens the estimate of significant activity (second
plot). The TFCE approach (third plot) allows analyzing each significant
point independently, but still has a broadened estimate. Note that
this is also FWER corrected. Finally, combining the TFCE and "hat"
methods tightens the area declared significant (again FWER corrected),
and allows for evaluation of each point independently instead of as
a single, broad cluster.
