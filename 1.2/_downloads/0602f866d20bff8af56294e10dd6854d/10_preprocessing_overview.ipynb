        "## What are artifacts?\n\nArtifacts are parts of the recorded signal that arise from sources other than\nthe source of interest (i.e., neuronal activity in the brain). As such,\nartifacts are a form of interference or noise relative to the signal of\ninterest. There are many possible causes of such interference, for example:\n\n- Environmental artifacts\n    - Persistent oscillations centered around the `AC power line frequency`_\n      (typically 50 or 60 Hz)\n    - Brief signal jumps due to building vibration (such as a door slamming)\n    - Electromagnetic field noise from nearby elevators, cell phones, the\n      geomagnetic field, etc.\n\n- Instrumentation artifacts\n    - Electromagnetic interference from stimulus presentation (such as EEG\n      sensors picking up the field generated by unshielded headphones)\n    - Continuous oscillations at specific frequencies used by head position\n      indicator (HPI) coils\n    - Random high-amplitude fluctuations (or alternatively, constant zero\n      signal) in a single channel due to sensor malfunction (e.g., in surface\n      electrodes, poor scalp contact)\n\n- Biological artifacts\n    - Periodic `QRS`_-like signal patterns (especially in magnetometer\n      channels) due to electrical activity of the heart\n    - Short step-like deflections (especially in frontal EEG channels) due to\n      eye movements\n    - Large transient deflections (especially in frontal EEG channels) due to\n      blinking\n    - Brief bursts of high frequency fluctuations across several channels due\n      to the muscular activity during swallowing\n\nThere are also some cases where signals from within the brain can be\nconsidered artifactual. For example, if a researcher is primarily interested\nin the sensory response to a stimulus, but the experimental paradigm involves\na behavioral response (such as button press), the neural activity associated\nwith the planning and executing the button press could be considered an\nartifact relative to signal of interest (i.e., the evoked sensory response).\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Artifacts of the same genesis may appear different in recordings made by\n    different EEG or MEG systems, due to differences in sensor design (e.g.,\n    passive vs. active EEG electrodes; axial vs. planar gradiometers, etc).</p></div>\n\n\n## What to do about artifacts\n\nThere are 3 basic options when faced with artifacts in your recordings:\n\n1. *Ignore* the artifact and carry on with analysis\n2. *Exclude* the corrupted portion of the data and analyze the remaining data\n3. *Repair* the artifact by suppressing artifactual part of the recording\n   while (hopefully) leaving the signal of interest intact\n\nThere are many different approaches to repairing artifacts, and MNE-Python\nincludes a variety of tools for artifact repair, including digital filtering,\nindependent components analysis (ICA), Maxwell filtering / signal-space\nseparation (SSS), and signal-space projection (SSP). Separate tutorials\ndemonstrate each of these techniques for artifact repair. Many of the\nartifact repair techniques work on both continuous (raw) data and on data\nthat has already been epoched (though not necessarily equally well); some can\nbe applied to `memory-mapped`_ data while others require the data to be\ncopied into RAM. Of course, before you can choose any of these strategies you\nmust first *detect* the artifacts, which is the topic of the next section.\n\n\n## Artifact detection\n\nMNE-Python includes a few tools for automated detection of certain artifacts\n(such as heartbeats and blinks), but of course you can always visually\ninspect your data to identify and annotate artifacts as well.\n\nWe saw in `the introductory tutorial <tut-overview>` that the example\ndata includes :term:`SSP projectors <projector>`, so before we look at\nartifacts let's set aside the projectors in a separate variable and then\nremove them from the :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object using the\n:meth:`~mne.io.Raw.del_proj` method, so that we can inspect our data in it's\noriginal, raw state:\n\n"
