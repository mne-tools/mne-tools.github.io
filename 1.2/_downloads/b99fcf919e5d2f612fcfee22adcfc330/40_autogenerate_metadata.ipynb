        "\n\n# Auto-generating Epochs metadata\n\nThis tutorial shows how to auto-generate metadata for `~mne.Epochs`, based on\nevents via `mne.epochs.make_metadata`.\n\nWe are going to use data from the `erp-core-dataset` (derived from\n:footcite:`Kappenman2021`). This is EEG data from a single participant\nperforming an active visual task (Eriksen flanker task).\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>If you wish to skip the introductory parts of this tutorial, you may jump\n   straight to `tut-autogenerate-metadata-ern` after completing the data\n   import and event creation in the\n   `tut-autogenerate-metadata-preparation` section.</p></div>\n\nThis tutorial is loosely divided into two parts:\n\n1. We will first focus on producing ERP time-locked to the **visual\n   stimulation**, conditional on response correctness and response time in\n   order to familiarize ourselves with the `~mne.epochs.make_metadata`\n   function.\n2. After that, we will calculate ERPs time-locked to the **responses** \u2013 again,\n   conditional on response correctness \u2013 to visualize the error-related\n   negativity (ERN), i.e. the ERP component associated with incorrect\n   behavioral responses.\n\n\n\n## Preparation\n\nLet's start by reading, filtering, and producing a simple visualization of the\nraw data. The data is pretty clean and contains very few blinks, so there's no\nneed to apply sophisticated preprocessing and data cleaning procedures.\nWe will also convert the `~mne.Annotations` contained in this dataset to events\nby calling `mne.events_from_annotations`.\n"

In the Flankers task of the ERP CORE\ndataset, participants were required to respond to visual stimuli by pressing\na button. We're interested in looking at the visual evoked responses (ERPs)\nof trials with correct responses. Assume that based on literature\nstudies, we decide that responses later than 1500 ms after stimulus onset are\nto be considered invalid, because they don't capture the neuronal processes\nof interest here.

        "### Specifying time-locked events\n\nWe can see that the generated table has 802 rows, each one corresponding to\nan individual event in ``all_events``. The first column, ``event_name``,\ncontains the name of the respective event around which the metadata of that\nspecific column was generated \u2013 we'll call that the \"time-locked event\",\nbecause we'll assign it time point zero.\n\nThe names of the remaining columns correspond to the event names specified in\nthe ``all_event_id`` dictionary. These columns contain floats; the values\nrepresent the latency of that specific event in seconds, relative to\nthe time-locked event (the one mentioned in the ``event_name`` column).\nFor events that didn't occur within the given time window, you'll see\na value of ``NaN``, simply indicating that no event latency could be\nextracted.\n\nNow, there's a problem here. We want investigate the visual ERPs only,\nconditional on responses. But the metadata that was just created contains\none row for **every** event, including responses. While we **could** create\nepochs for all events, allowing us to pass those metadata, and later subset\nthe created events, there's a more elegant way to handle things:\n`~mne.epochs.make_metadata` has a ``row_events`` parameter that\nallows us to specify for which events to create metadata **rows**, while\nstill creating **columns for all events** in the ``event_id`` dictionary.\n\nBecause the metadata, then, only pertains to a subset of our original events,\nit's important to keep the returned ``events`` and ``event_id`` around for\nlater use when we're actually going to create our epochs, to ensure that\nmetadata, events, and event descriptions stay in sync.\n\n"

Great!\n\nWe have two types of responses in our data: ``response/left`` and\n``response/right``.

This works by passing a subset of the\n:term:`hierarchical event descriptors` (HEDs, inspired by\n:footcite:`BigdelyShamloEtAl2013`) used to name events via the ``keep_first``\nparameter. For example, in the case of the HEDs ``response/left`` and\n``response/right``, we could pass ``keep_first='response'`` to generate a new\ncolumn, ``response``, containing the latency of the respective event. This\nvalue pertains only the first (or, in this specific example: the only)\nresponse, regardless of side (left or right). To indicate **which** event\ntype (here: response side) was matched, a second column is added:\n``first_response``. The values in this column are the event types without the\nstring used for matching, as it is already encoded as the column name, i.e.\nin our example, we expect it to only contain ``'left'`` and ``'right'``.\n\n"

        "We can see a strong negative deflection immediately after incorrect\nresponses, compared to correct responses. The topoplot, too, leaves no doubt:\nwhat we're looking at is, in fact, the ERN.\n\nSome researchers suggest to construct the difference wave between ERPs for\ncorrect and incorrect responses, as it more clearly reveals signal\ndifferences, while ideally also improving the signal-to-noise ratio (under\nthe assumption that the noise level in \"correct\" and \"incorrect\" trials is\nsimilar). Let's do just that and put it into a publication-ready\nvisualization.\n\n"
