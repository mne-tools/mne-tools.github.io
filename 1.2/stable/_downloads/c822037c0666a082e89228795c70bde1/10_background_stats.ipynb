        "### Clustering\nEach of the aforementioned multiple comparisons corrections have the\ndisadvantage of not fully incorporating the correlation structure of the\ndata, namely that points close to one another (e.g., in space or time) tend\nto be correlated. However, by defining the adjacency (or \"neighbor\")\nstructure in our data, we can use **clustering** to compensate.\n\nTo use this, we need to rethink our null hypothesis. Instead\nof thinking about a null hypothesis about means per voxel (with one\nindependent test per voxel), we consider a null hypothesis about sizes\nof clusters in our data, which could be stated like:\n\n    The distribution of spatial cluster sizes observed in two experimental\n    conditions are drawn from the same probability distribution.\n\nHere we only have a single condition and we contrast to zero, which can\nbe thought of as:\n\n    The distribution of spatial cluster sizes is independent of the sign\n    of the data.\n\nIn this case, we again do permutations with a maximum statistic, but, under\neach permutation, we:\n\n1. Compute the test statistic for each voxel individually.\n2. Threshold the test statistic values.\n3. Cluster voxels that exceed this threshold (with the same sign) based on\n   adjacency.\n4. Retain the size of the largest cluster (measured, e.g., by a simple voxel\n   count, or by the sum of voxel t-values within the cluster) to build the\n   null distribution.\n\nAfter doing these permutations, the cluster sizes in our veridical data\nare compared to this null distribution. The p-value associated with each\ncluster is again given by the proportion of smaller null distribution\nvalues. This can then be subjected to a standard p-value threshold\n(e.g., p < 0.05) to reject the null hypothesis (i.e., find an effect of\ninterest).\n\nThis reframing to consider *cluster sizes* rather than *individual means*\nmaintains the advantages of the standard non-parametric permutation\ntest -- namely controlling FWER and making no assumptions of parametric\ndata distribution.\nCritically, though, it also accounts for the correlation structure in the\ndata -- which in this toy case is spatial but in general can be\nmultidimensional (e.g., spatio-temporal) -- because the null distribution\nwill be derived from data in a way that preserves these correlations.\n\n.. admonition:: Effect size\n    :class: sidebar note\n\n    For a nice description of how to compute the effect size obtained\n    in a cluster test, see this\n    [FieldTrip mailing list discussion](ft_cluster_effect_size_).\n\nHowever, there is a drawback. If a cluster significantly deviates from\nthe null, no further inference on the cluster (e.g., peak location) can be\nmade, as the entire cluster as a whole is used to reject the null.\nMoreover, because the test statistic concerns the full data, the null\nhypothesis (and our rejection of it) refers to the structure of the full\ndata. For more information, see also the comprehensive\n[FieldTrip tutorial](ft_cluster_).\n\n#### Defining the adjacency matrix\nFirst we need to define our adjacency (sometimes called \"neighbors\") matrix.\nThis is a square array (or sparse matrix) of shape ``(n_src, n_src)`` that\ncontains zeros and ones to define which spatial points are neighbors, i.e.,\nwhich voxels are adjacent to each other. In our case this\nis quite simple, as our data are aligned on a rectangular grid.\n\nLet's pretend that our data were smaller -- a 3 \u00d7 3 grid. Thinking about\neach voxel as being connected to the other voxels it touches, we would\nneed a 9 \u00d7 9 adjacency matrix. The first row of this matrix contains the\nvoxels in the flattened data that the first voxel touches. Since it touches\nthe second element in the first row and the first element in the second row\n(and is also a neighbor to itself), this would be::\n\n    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\n:mod:`sklearn.feature_extraction` provides a convenient function for this:\n\n"

        "The first three columns show the parametric and non-parametric statistics\nthat are not corrected for multiple comparisons:\n\n- Mass univariate **t-tests** result in jagged edges.\n- **\"Hat\" variance correction** of the t-tests produces less peaky edges,\n  correcting for sharpness in the statistic driven by low-variance voxels.\n- **Non-parametric resampling tests** are very similar to t-tests. This is to\n  be expected: the data are drawn from a Gaussian distribution, and thus\n  satisfy parametric assumptions.\n\nThe next three columns show multiple comparison corrections of the\nmass univariate tests (parametric and non-parametric). These\ntoo conservatively correct for multiple comparisons because neighboring\nvoxels in our data are correlated:\n\n- **Bonferroni correction** eliminates any significant activity.\n- **FDR correction** is less conservative than Bonferroni.\n- A **permutation test with a maximum statistic** also eliminates any\n  significant activity.\n\nThe final four columns show the non-parametric cluster-based permutation\ntests with a maximum statistic:\n\n- **Standard clustering** identifies the correct region. However, the whole\n  area must be declared significant, so no peak analysis can be done.\n  Also, the peak is broad.\n- **Clustering with \"hat\" variance adjustment** tightens the estimate of\n  significant activity.\n- **Clustering with TFCE** allows analyzing each significant point\n  independently, but still has a broadened estimate.\n- **Clustering with TFCE and \"hat\" variance adjustment** tightens the area\n  declared significant (again FWER corrected).\n\n## Statistical functions in MNE\nThe complete listing of statistical functions provided by MNE are in\nthe `Statistics API list <api_reference_statistics>`, but we will give\na brief overview here.\n\nMNE provides several convenience parametric testing functions that can be\nused in conjunction with the non-parametric clustering methods. However,\nthe set of functions we provide is not meant to be exhaustive.\n\nIf the univariate statistical contrast of interest is not listed here\n(e.g., interaction term in an unbalanced ANOVA), consider checking out the\n:mod:`statsmodels` package. It offers many functions for computing\nstatistical contrasts, e.g., :func:`statsmodels.stats.anova.anova_lm`.\nTo use these functions in clustering:\n\n1. Determine which test statistic (e.g., t-value, F-value) you would use\n   in a univariate context to compute your contrast of interest. In other\n   words, if there were only a single output such as reaction times, what\n   test statistic might you compute on the data?\n2. Wrap the call to that function within a function that takes an input of\n   the same shape that is expected by your clustering function,\n   and returns an array of the same shape without the \"samples\" dimension\n   (e.g., :func:`mne.stats.permutation_cluster_1samp_test` takes an array\n   of shape ``(n_samples, p, q)`` and returns an array of shape ``(p, q)``).\n3. Pass this wrapped function to the ``stat_fun`` argument to the clustering\n   function.\n4. Set an appropriate ``threshold`` value (float or dict) based on the\n   values your statistical contrast function returns.\n\n### Parametric methods provided by MNE\n\n- :func:`mne.stats.ttest_1samp_no_p`\n    Paired t-test, optionally with hat adjustment.\n    This is used by default for contrast enhancement in paired cluster tests.\n\n- :func:`mne.stats.f_oneway`\n    One-way ANOVA for independent samples.\n    This can be used to compute various F-contrasts. It is used by default\n    for contrast enhancement in non-paired cluster tests.\n\n- :func:`mne.stats.f_mway_rm`\n    M-way ANOVA for repeated measures and balanced designs.\n    This returns F-statistics and p-values. The associated helper function\n    :func:`mne.stats.f_threshold_mway_rm` can be used to determine the\n    F-threshold at a given significance level.\n\n- :func:`mne.stats.linear_regression`\n    Compute ordinary least square regressions on multiple targets, e.g.,\n    sensors, time points across trials (samples).\n    For each regressor it returns the beta value, t-statistic, and\n    uncorrected p-value. While it can be used as a test, it is\n    particularly useful to compute weighted averages or deal with\n    continuous predictors.\n\n### Non-parametric methods\n\n- :func:`mne.stats.permutation_cluster_test`\n    Unpaired contrasts with clustering.\n\n- :func:`mne.stats.spatio_temporal_cluster_test`\n    Unpaired contrasts with spatio-temporal clustering.\n\n- :func:`mne.stats.permutation_t_test`\n    Paired contrast with no clustering.\n\n- :func:`mne.stats.permutation_cluster_1samp_test`\n    Paired contrasts with clustering.\n\n- :func:`mne.stats.spatio_temporal_cluster_1samp_test`\n    Paired contrasts with spatio-temporal clustering.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-danger\"><h4>Warning</h4><p>In most MNE functions, data has shape\n             ``(..., n_space, n_time)``, where the spatial dimension can\n             be e.g. sensors or source vertices. But for our spatio-temporal\n             clustering functions, the spatial dimensions need to be **last**\n             for computational efficiency reasons. For example, for\n             :func:`mne.stats.spatio_temporal_cluster_1samp_test`, ``X``\n             needs to be of shape ``(n_samples, n_time, n_space)``. You can\n             use :func:`numpy.transpose` to transpose axes if necessary.</p></div>\n\n## References\n.. footbibliography::\n\n.. include:: ../../links.inc\n\n"
