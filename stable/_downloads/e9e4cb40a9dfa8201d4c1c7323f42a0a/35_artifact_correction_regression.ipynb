Blink artifacts captured by bipolar EOG channels provide a good\nexample of this, so we will demonstrate this here.\n\nAlthough ECG signals are well captured by bipolar ECG electrodes,\nregression-based removal of ECG artifacts usually does not work very well.\nThis is likely because the heart acts like a rotating dipole, and\ntherefore the ECG channel time waveform recorded from the ECG electrode sites\ndoes not reflect the same temporal dynamics that manifest at each MEG channel\n(obtained by sampling some component of the related magnetic vector field).\nOther approaches like `ICA <tut-artifact-ica>` or\n`SSP <tut-artifact-ssp>` will likely work better for ECG.\n\nFurthermore, regression approaches are usually performed in situations where\nthere are few channels available, and removing an entire signal component is\nundesirable. Hence, most articles on the topic concern EEG and it is\nunusual to see the technique applied to MEG. For this reason, we will restrict\nthe analysis in this tutorial to EEG data only.\n\n\n## Prepare the data\n\nWe begin as always by importing the necessary Python modules and loading some\ndata. The `MNE-Sample <sample-dataset>` dataset has some clear, large\nblink artifacts, especially during the presentation of visual stimuli.\n"

        "Regressing the EOG signal out of the EEG signals has reduced the peak around\n250ms that was partly there because of eye artifacts.\n\nIn the `MNE-Sample dataset <sample-dataset>`, there are no segments of\ndata that are particularly unstable, so the basic form of regression produces\nrobust coefficients. However, this may not be the case in every dataset, so\nlet's explore some variations that may improve the estimation of the\nregression coefficients.\n\nOne potential problem is that the EOG sensor does not only pick up eye\nartifacts, but also a bit of EEG signal. This means we are prone to\noverestimating the regression coefficients if the EOG sensors are placed too\nclose to the EEG sensors. However, there is a correction we can apply to\nalleviate this.\n\n## Subtract the evoked response from the epoch data before regression\nGratton et al.

        "We see that we obtain the same regression coefficients, even with the evoked\nremoved from the epochs.\n\n## Create EOG evoked before regression\nIt is advantageous to estimate the regression coefficients on a piece of data\nwith lots of EOG activity. As EOG activity is typically much larger than EEG,\nthe EOG artifacts will dominate the signal and the regression coefficients\nwill reflect mostly the influence of the EOG. To amplify this effect, Croft &\nBarry (2000) :footcite:`CroftBarry2000` suggest creating epochs based on\nblink onsets and computing the evoked blink response. The averaging procedure\nwill suppress EEG signals that are not strictly time-locked with the blink\nresponse. Ideally, one would create evokeds for both blinks and saccades, and\ncreate two separate regression models. However, we will restrict ourselves to\njust blink epochs, since MNE-Python contains an automated method for creating\nthose.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>This is very similar to the approach taken by `SSP\n          <tut-artifact-ssp>`. The difference is that `SSP\n          <tut-artifact-ssp>` estimates signal components that are maximally\n          correlated with the artifact and removes any data along that\n          component (thereby reducing the rank of the non-EOG data), whereas\n          the regression approach uses the ongoing EOG signal to determine\n          how much data to remove (thereby not necessarily reducing the rank\n          of the non-EOG data). Generally, SSP tends to err on the side of\n          removing too much data, eliminating artifacts and true brain\n          signals alike, whereas regression will err on the side of not\n          removing enough, leaving some artifact signals still present in the\n          signal.</p></div>\n\n"
