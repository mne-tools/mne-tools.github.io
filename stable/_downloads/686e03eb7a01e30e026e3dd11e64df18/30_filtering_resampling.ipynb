        "## Background on filtering\n\nA filter removes or attenuates parts of a signal. Usually, filters act on\nspecific *frequency ranges* of a signal \u2014 for example, suppressing all\nfrequency components above or below a certain cutoff value. There are *many*\nways of designing digital filters; see `disc-filtering` for a longer\ndiscussion of the various approaches to filtering physiological signals in\nMNE-Python.\n\n\n## Repairing artifacts by filtering\n\nArtifacts that are restricted to a narrow frequency range can sometimes\nbe repaired by filtering the data. Two examples of frequency-restricted\nartifacts are slow drifts and power line noise. Here we illustrate how each\nof these can be repaired by filtering.\n\n\n### Slow drifts\n\nLow-frequency drifts in raw data can usually be spotted by plotting a fairly\nlong span of data with the :meth:`~mne.io.Raw.plot` method, though it is\nhelpful to disable channel-wise DC shift correction to make slow drifts\nmore readily visible. Here we plot 60 seconds, showing all the magnetometer\nchannels:\n\n"

In cases where high-frequency components of the signal\nare not of interest and precise timing is not needed (e.g., computing EOG or\nECG projectors on a long recording), downsampling the signal can be a useful\ntime-saver.\n\nIn MNE-Python, the resampling methods (:meth:`raw.resample()\n<mne.io.Raw.resample>`, :meth:`epochs.resample() <mne.Epochs.resample>` and\n:meth:`evoked.resample() <mne.Evoked.resample>`) apply a low-pass filter to\nthe signal to avoid `aliasing`_, so you don't need to explicitly filter it\nyourself first.

This can be clearly seen in the\nPSD plot, where a dashed vertical line indicates the filter cutoff; the\noriginal data had an existing lowpass at around 172 Hz (see\n``raw.info['lowpass']``), and the data resampled from ~600 Hz to 200 Hz gets\nautomatically lowpass filtered at 100 Hz (the `Nyquist frequency`_ for a\ntarget rate of 200 Hz):\n\n"

        "Because resampling involves filtering, there are some pitfalls to resampling\nat different points in the analysis stream:\n\n- Performing resampling on :class:`~mne.io.Raw` data (*before* epoching) will\n  negatively affect the temporal precision of Event arrays, by causing\n  `jitter`_ in the event timing. This reduced temporal precision will\n  propagate to subsequent epoching operations.\n\n- Performing resampling *after* epoching can introduce edge artifacts *on\n  every epoch*, whereas filtering the :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object will only\n  introduce artifacts at the start and end of the recording (which is often\n  far enough from the first and last epochs to have no affect on the\n  analysis).\n\nThe following section suggests best practices to mitigate both of these\nissues.\n\n\n### Best practices\n\nTo avoid the reduction in temporal precision of events that comes with\nresampling a :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object, and also avoid the edge artifacts\nthat come with filtering an :class:`~mne.Epochs` or :class:`~mne.Evoked`\nobject, the best practice is to:\n\n1. low-pass filter the :class:`~mne.io.Raw` data at or below\n   $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the desired sample rate, then\n\n2. decimate the data after epoching, by either passing the ``decim``\n   parameter to the :class:`~mne.Epochs` constructor, or using the\n   :meth:`~mne.Epochs.decimate` method after the :class:`~mne.Epochs` have\n   been created.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-danger\"><h4>Warning</h4><p>The recommendation for setting the low-pass corner frequency at\n   $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the desired sample rate is a fairly safe rule of\n   thumb based on the default settings in :meth:`raw.filter()\n   <mne.io.Raw.filter>` (which are different from the filter settings used\n   inside the :meth:`raw.resample() <mne.io.Raw.resample>` method). If you\n   use a customized lowpass filter (specifically, if your transition\n   bandwidth is wider than 0.5\u00d7 the lowpass cutoff), downsampling to 3\u00d7 the\n   lowpass cutoff may still not be enough to avoid `aliasing`_, and\n   MNE-Python will not warn you about it (because the :class:`raw.info\n   <mne.Info>` object only keeps track of the lowpass cutoff, not the\n   transition bandwidth). Conversely, if you use a steeper filter, the\n   warning may be too sensitive. If you are unsure, plot the PSD of your\n   filtered data *before decimating* and ensure that there is no content in\n   the frequencies above the `Nyquist frequency`_ of the sample rate you'll\n   end up with *after* decimation.</p></div>\n\nNote that this method of manually filtering and decimating is exact only when\nthe original sampling frequency is an integer multiple of the desired new\nsampling frequency. Since the sampling frequency of our example data is\n600.614990234375 Hz, ending up with a specific sampling frequency like (say)\n90 Hz will not be possible:\n\n"
