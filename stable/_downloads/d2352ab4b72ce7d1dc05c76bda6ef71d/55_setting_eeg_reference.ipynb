        "## Background\n\nEEG measures a voltage (difference in electric potential) between each\nelectrode and a reference electrode. This means that whatever signal is\npresent at the reference electrode is effectively subtracted from all the\nmeasurement electrodes. Therefore, an ideal reference signal is one that\ncaptures *none* of the brain-specific fluctuations in electric potential,\nwhile capturing *all* of the environmental noise/interference that is being\npicked up by the measurement electrodes.\n\nIn practice, this means that the reference electrode is often placed in a\nlocation on the subject's body and close to their head (so that any\nenvironmental interference affects the reference and measurement electrodes\nsimilarly) but as far away from the neural sources as possible (so that the\nreference signal doesn't pick up brain-based fluctuations). Typical reference\nlocations are the subject's earlobe, nose, mastoid process, or collarbone.\nEach of these has advantages and disadvantages regarding how much brain\nsignal it picks up (e.g., the mastoids pick up a fair amount compared to the\nothers), and regarding the environmental noise it picks up (e.g., earlobe\nelectrodes may shift easily, and have signals more similar to electrodes on\nthe same side of the head).\n\nEven in cases where no electrode is specifically designated as the reference,\nEEG recording hardware will still treat one of the scalp electrodes as the\nreference, and the recording software may or may not display it to you (it\nmight appear as a completely flat channel, or the software might subtract out\nthe average of all signals before displaying, making it *look like* there is\nno reference).\n\n\n## Setting or changing the reference channel\n\nIf you want to recompute your data with a different reference than was used\nwhen the raw data were recorded and/or saved, MNE-Python provides the\n:meth:`~mne.io.Raw.set_eeg_reference` method on :class:`~mne.io.Raw` objects\nas well as the :func:`mne.add_reference_channels` function. To use an\nexisting channel as the new reference, use the\n:meth:`~mne.io.Raw.set_eeg_reference` method; you can also designate multiple\nexisting electrodes as reference channels, as is sometimes done with mastoid\nreferences:\n\n"

        "## EEG reference and source modeling\n\nIf you plan to perform source modeling (either with EEG or combined EEG/MEG\ndata), it is **strongly recommended** to use the\naverage-reference-as-projection approach. It is important to use an average\nreference because using a specific\nreference sensor (or even an average of a few sensors) spreads the forward\nmodel error from the reference sensor(s) into all sensors, effectively\namplifying the importance of the reference sensor(s) when computing source\nestimates. In contrast, using the average of all EEG channels as reference\nspreads the forward modeling error evenly across channels, so no one channel\nis weighted more strongly during source estimation. See also this `FieldTrip\nFAQ on average referencing`_ for more information.\n\nThe main reason for specifying the average reference as a projector was\nmentioned in the previous section: an average reference projector adapts if\nchannels are dropped, ensuring that the signal will always be zero-mean when\nthe source modeling is performed. In contrast, applying an average reference\nby the traditional subtraction method offers no such guarantee.\n\n.. important:: For these reasons, when performing inverse imaging, MNE-Python\n               will raise a ``ValueError`` if there are EEG channels present\n               and something other than an average reference projector strategy\n               has been specified. To ensure correct functioning consider\n               calling :meth:`set_eeg_reference(projection=True)\n               <mne.io.Raw.set_eeg_reference>` to add an average\n               reference as a projector.\n\n..
