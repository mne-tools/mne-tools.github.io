        "\n\n# Parsing events from raw data\n\nThis tutorial describes how to read experimental events from raw recordings,\nand how to convert between the two different representations of events within\nMNE-Python (Events arrays and Annotations objects).\n\nIn the `introductory tutorial <overview-tut-events-section>` we saw an\nexample of reading experimental events from a :term:`\"STIM\" channel <stim\nchannel>`; here we'll discuss :term:`events` and :term:`annotations` more\nbroadly, give more detailed information about reading from STIM channels, and\ngive an example of reading events that are in a marker file or included in\nthe data file as an embedded array. The tutorials `tut-event-arrays` and\n`tut-annotate-raw` discuss how to plot, combine, load, save, and\nexport :term:`events` and :class:`~mne.Annotations` (respectively), and the\nlatter tutorial also covers interactive annotation of :class:`~mne.io.Raw`\nobjects.\n\nWe'll begin by loading the Python modules we need, and loading the same\n`example data <sample-dataset>` we used in the `introductory tutorial\n<tut-overview>`, but to save memory we'll crop the :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object\nto just 60 seconds before loading it into RAM:\n"

        "## The Events and Annotations data structures\n\nGenerally speaking, both the Events and :class:`~mne.Annotations` data\nstructures serve the same purpose: they provide a mapping between times\nduring an EEG/MEG recording and a description of what happened at those\ntimes. In other words, they associate a *when* with a *what*. The main\ndifferences are:\n\n1. **Units**: the Events data structure represents the *when* in terms of\n   samples, whereas the :class:`~mne.Annotations` data structure represents\n   the *when* in seconds.\n2. **Limits on the description**: the Events data structure represents the\n   *what* as an integer \"Event ID\" code, whereas the\n   :class:`~mne.Annotations` data structure represents the *what* as a\n   string.\n3. **How duration is encoded**: Events in an Event array do not have a\n   duration (though it is possible to represent duration with pairs of\n   onset/offset events within an Events array), whereas each element of an\n   :class:`~mne.Annotations` object necessarily includes a duration (though\n   the duration can be zero if an instantaneous event is desired).\n4. **Internal representation**: Events are stored as an ordinary\n   :class:`NumPy array <numpy.ndarray>`, whereas :class:`~mne.Annotations` is\n   a :class:`list`-like class defined in MNE-Python.\n\n\n\n## What is a STIM channel?\n\nA :term:`stim channel` (short for \"stimulus channel\") is a channel that does\nnot receive signals from an EEG, MEG, or other sensor. Instead, STIM channels\nrecord voltages (usually short, rectangular DC pulses of fixed magnitudes\nsent from the experiment-controlling computer) that are time-locked to\nexperimental events, such as the onset of a stimulus or a button-press\nresponse by the subject (those pulses are sometimes called `TTL`_ pulses,\nevent pulses, trigger signals, or just \"triggers\"). In other cases, these\npulses may not be strictly time-locked to an experimental event, but instead\nmay occur in between trials to indicate the type of stimulus (or experimental\ncondition) that is about to occur on the upcoming trial.\n\nThe DC pulses may be all on one STIM channel (in which case different\nexperimental events or trial types are encoded as different voltage\nmagnitudes), or they may be spread across several channels, in which case the\nchannel(s) on which the pulse(s) occur can be used to encode different events\nor conditions. Even on systems with multiple STIM channels, there is often\none channel that records a weighted sum of the other STIM channels, in such a\nway that voltage levels on that channel can be unambiguously decoded as\nparticular event types. On older Neuromag systems (such as that used to\nrecord the sample data) this \"summation channel\" was typically ``STI 014``;\non newer systems it is more commonly ``STI101``. You can see the STIM\nchannels in the raw data file here:\n\n"

You can also see that every time there is a pulse on one of the\nother STIM channels, there is a corresponding pulse on ``STI 014``.\n\n.. TODO: somewhere in prev. section, link out to a table of which systems\n   have STIM channels vs. which have marker files or embedded event arrays\n   (once such a table has been created).\n\n\n## Converting a STIM channel signal to an Events array\n\nIf your data has events recorded on a STIM channel, you can convert them into\nan events array using :func:`mne.find_events`.

        ".. sidebar:: The middle column of the Events array\n\n    MNE-Python events are actually *three* values: in between the sample\n    number and the integer event code is a value indicating what the event\n    code was on the immediately preceding sample. In practice, that value is\n    almost always ``0``, but it can be used to detect the *endpoint* of an\n    event whose duration is longer than one sample. See the documentation of\n    :func:`mne.find_events` for more details.\n\nIf you don't provide the name of a STIM channel, :func:`~mne.find_events`\nwill first look for MNE-Python `config variables <tut-configure-mne>`\nfor variables ``MNE_STIM_CHANNEL``, ``MNE_STIM_CHANNEL_1``, etc. If those are\nnot found, channels ``STI 014`` and ``STI101`` are tried, followed by the\nfirst channel with type \"STIM\" present in ``raw.ch_names``. If you regularly\nwork with data from several different MEG systems with different STIM channel\nnames, setting the ``MNE_STIM_CHANNEL`` config variable may not be very\nuseful, but for researchers whose data is all from a single system it can be\na time-saver to configure that variable once and then forget about it.\n\n:func:`~mne.find_events` has several options, including options for aligning\nevents to the onset or offset of the STIM channel pulses, setting the minimum\npulse duration, and handling of consecutive pulses (with no return to zero\nbetween them). For example, you can effectively encode event duration by\npassing ``output='step'`` to :func:`mne.find_events`; see the documentation\nof :func:`~mne.find_events` for details. More information on working with\nevents arrays (including how to plot, combine, load, and save event arrays)\ncan be found in the tutorial `tut-event-arrays`.\n\n\n## Reading embedded events as Annotations\n\nSome EEG/MEG systems generate files where events are stored in a separate\ndata array rather than as pulses on one or more STIM channels. For example,\nthe EEGLAB format stores events as a collection of arrays in the :file:`.set`\nfile. When reading those files, MNE-Python will automatically convert the\nstored events into an :class:`~mne.Annotations` object and store it as the\n:attr:`~mne.io.Raw.annotations` attribute of the :class:`~mne.io.Raw` object:\n\n"
