==================================================
Compute a cross-spectral density (CSD) matrix
==================================================

A cross-spectral density (CSD) matrix is similar to a covariance matrix, but in
the time-frequency domain. It is the first step towards computing
sensor-to-sensor coherence or a DICS beamformer.

This script demonstrates the three methods that MNE-Python provides to compute
the CSD:

1. Using short-term Fourier transform: :func:`mne.time_frequency.csd_fourier`
2. Using a multitaper approach: :func:`mne.time_frequency.csd_multitaper`
3. Using Morlet wavelets: :func:`mne.time_frequency.csd_morlet`

    import mne
    from mne.datasets import sample
    from mne.time_frequency import csd_fourier, csd_multitaper, csd_morlet

    print(__doc__)







In the following example, the computation of the CSD matrices can be
performed using multiple cores. Set ``n_jobs`` to a value >1 to select the
number of cores to use.

    n_jobs = 1







Loading the sample dataset.


.. code-block:: python

    data_path = sample.data_path()
    fname_raw = data_path + '/MEG/sample/sample_audvis_raw.fif'
    fname_event = data_path + '/MEG/sample/sample_audvis_raw-eve.fif'
    raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif(fname_raw)
    events = mne.read_events(fname_event)

By default, CSD matrices are computed using all MEG/EEG channels. When
interpreting a CSD matrix with mixed sensor types, be aware that the
measurement units, and thus the scalings, differ across sensors. In this
example, for speed and clarity, we select a single channel type:
gradiometers.


.. code-block:: python

    picks = mne.pick_types(raw.info, meg='grad')

    # Make some epochs, based on events with trigger code 1
    epochs = mne.Epochs(raw, events, event_id=1, tmin=0, tmax=1,
                        picks=picks, baseline=(None, 0),
                        reject=dict(grad=4000e-13), preload=True)

Computing CSD matrices using short-term Fourier transform and (adaptive)
multitapers is straightforward:


.. code-block:: python

    csd_fft = csd_fourier(epochs, fmin=15, fmax=20, n_jobs=n_jobs)
    csd_mt = csd_multitaper(epochs, fmin=15, fmax=20, adaptive=True, n_jobs=n_jobs)

When computing the CSD with Morlet wavelets, you specify the exact
frequencies at which to compute it. For each frequency, a corresponding
wavelet will be constructed and convolved with the signal, resulting in a
time-frequency decomposition.

The CSD is constructed by computing the correlation between the
time-frequency representations between all sensor-to-sensor pairs. The
time-frequency decomposition originally has the same sampling rate as the
signal, in our case ~600Hz. This means the decomposition is over-specified in
time and we may not need to use all samples during our CSD computation, just
enough to get a reliable correlation statistic. By specifying ``decim=10``,
we use every 10th sample, which will greatly speed up the computation and
will have a minimal effect on the CSD.
