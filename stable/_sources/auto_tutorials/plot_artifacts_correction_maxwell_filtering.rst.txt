=======================================
Artifact correction with Maxwell filter
=======================================

This tutorial shows how to clean MEG data with Maxwell filtering.

Maxwell filtering in MNE can be used to suppress sources of external
interference and compensate for subject head movements.

See :ref:`maxwell` for more details.


.. code-block:: python


    import mne
    from mne.preprocessing import maxwell_filter

    data_path = mne.datasets.sample.data_path()







Set parameters


.. code-block:: python

    raw_fname = data_path + '/MEG/sample/sample_audvis_raw.fif'
    ctc_fname = data_path + '/SSS/ct_sparse_mgh.fif'
    fine_cal_fname = data_path + '/SSS/sss_cal_mgh.dat'







Preprocess with Maxwell filtering


.. code-block:: python

    raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif(raw_fname)
    raw.info['bads'] = ['MEG 2443', 'EEG 053', 'MEG 1032', 'MEG 2313']  # set bads
    # Here we don't use tSSS (set st_duration) because MGH data is very clean
    raw_sss = maxwell_filter(raw, cross_talk=ctc_fname, calibration=fine_cal_fname)
