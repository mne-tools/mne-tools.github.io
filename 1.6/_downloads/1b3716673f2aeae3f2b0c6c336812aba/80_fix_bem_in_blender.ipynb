        "\n\n# Fixing BEM and head surfaces\n\nSometimes when creating a BEM model the surfaces need manual correction because\nof a series of problems that can arise (e.g. intersection between surfaces).\nHere, we will see how this can be achieved by exporting the surfaces to the 3D\nmodeling program [Blender](https://blender.org), editing them, and\nre-importing them. We will also give a simple example of how to use\n`pymeshfix <tut-fix-meshes-pymeshfix>` to fix topological problems.\n\nMuch of this tutorial is based on\nhttps://github.com/ezemikulan/blender_freesurfer by Ezequiel Mikulan.\n"

You are ready to continue with your analysis pipeline (e.g.\nrunning :func:`mne.make_bem_model`).\n\n## What if you still get an error?\n\n### Blender operations\nWhen editing BEM surfaces/meshes in Blender, make sure to use\ntools that do not change the number or order of vertices, or the geometry\nof triangular faces. For example, avoid the extrusion tool, because it\nduplicates the extruded vertices.\n\n\n### Cleaning up a bad dense head surface by smoothing\nIf you get a rough head surfaces when using `mne make_scalp_surfaces`,\nconsider smoothing your T1 ahead of time with a Gaussian kernel with\nFreeSurfer using something like the following within the subject's ``mri``\ndirectory:\n\n```console\n$ mri_convert --fwhm 3 T1.mgz T1_smoothed_3.mgz\n```\nHere the ``--fwhm`` argument determines how much smoothing (in mm) to apply.\nThen delete ``SUBJECTS_DIR/SUBJECT/surf/lh.seghead``, and re-run\n`mne make_scalp_surfaces` with the additional arguments\n``--mri=\"T1_smoothed_3.mgz\" --overwrite``, and you should get cleaner\nsurfaces.\n\n### Topological errors\nMNE-Python requires that meshes satisfy some topological checks to ensure\nthat subsequent processing like BEM solving and electrode projection can\nwork properly.\n\nBelow are some examples of errors you might encounter when working with\nmeshes in MNE-Python, and the likely causes of those errors.\n\n1. Cannot decimate to requested ico grade\n     This error is caused by having too few or too many vertices. The full\n     error is something like:\n\n```text\nRuntimeError: Cannot decimate to requested ico grade 4. The provided\nBEM surface has 20516 triangles, which cannot be isomorphic with a\nsubdivided icosahedron. Consider manually decimating the surface to a\nsuitable density and then use ico=None in make_bem_model.\n```\n2. Surface inner skull has topological defects\n     This error can occur when trying to match the original number of\n     triangles by removing vertices. The full error looks like:\n\n```text\nRuntimeError: Surface inner skull has topological defects: 12 / 20484\nvertices have fewer than three neighboring triangles [733, 1014,\n 2068, 7732, 8435, 8489, 10181, 11120, 11121, 11122, 11304, 11788]\n```\n3. Surface inner skull is not complete\n     This error (like the previous error) reflects a problem with the surface\n     topology (i.e., the expected pattern of vertices/edges/faces is\n     disrupted).\n\n```text\nRuntimeError: Surface inner skull is not complete (sum of solid\nangles yielded 0.999668, should be 1.)\n```\n4. Triangle ordering is wrong\n     This error reflects a mismatch between how the surface is represented in\n     memory (the order of the vertex/face definitions) and what is expected\n     by MNE-Python. The full error is:\n\n```text\nRuntimeError: The source surface has a matching number of triangles\nbut ordering is wrong\n```\n#### Dealing with topology in blender\nFor any of these errors, it is usually easiest to start over with the\nunedited BEM surface and try again, making sure to only *move* vertices and\nfaces without *adding* or *deleting* any. For example,\nselect a circle of vertices, then press :kbd:`G` to drag them to the desired\nlocation. Smoothing a group of selected vertices in Blender (by\nright-clicking and selecting \"Smooth Vertices\") can also be helpful.\n\n\n#### Dealing with topology using pymeshfix\n[pymeshfix](https://pymeshfix.pyvista.org/)_ is a GPL-licensed Python\nmodule designed to produce water-tight meshes that satisfy the topological\nchecks listed above. For example, if your\n``'SUBJECTS_DIR/SUBJECT/surf/lh.seghead'`` has topological problems and\n`tut-fix-meshes-smoothing` does not work, you can try fixing the mesh\ninstead. After installing ``pymeshfix`` using conda or pip, from within the\n``'SUBJECTS_DIR/SUBJECT/surf'`` directory, you could try::\n\n    >>> import pymeshfix\n    >>> rr, tris = mne.read_surface('lh.seghead')\n    >>> rr, tris = pymeshfix.clean_from_arrays(rr, tris)\n    >>> mne.write_surface('lh.seghead', rr, tris)\n\nIn some cases this could fix the topology such that a subsequent call to\n`mne make_scalp_surfaces` will succeed without needing to use the\n``--force`` parameter.\n\n"
