        "\n\n# Frequency-tagging: Basic analysis of an SSVEP/vSSR dataset\n\nIn this tutorial we compute the frequency spectrum and quantify signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) at a target frequency in EEG data recorded during fast periodic\nvisual stimulation (FPVS) at 12 Hz and 15 Hz in different trials.\nExtracting SNR at stimulation frequency is a simple way to quantify frequency\ntagged responses in MEEG (a.k.a. steady state visually evoked potentials,\nSSVEP, or visual steady-state responses, vSSR in the visual domain,\nor auditory steady-state responses, ASSR in the auditory domain).\n\nFor a general introduction to the method see\n[Norcia et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1167/15.6.4) for the visual domain,\nand [Picton et al. (2003)](https://doi.org/10.3109/14992020309101316) for\nthe auditory domain.\n\n**Data and outline:**\n\nWe use a simple example dataset with frequency tagged visual stimulation:\nN=2 participants observed checkerboard patterns inverting with a constant\nfrequency of either 12.0 Hz of 15.0 Hz.\n32 channels wet EEG was recorded.\n(see `ssvep-dataset` for more information).\n\nWe will visualize both the power-spectral density (PSD) and the SNR\nspectrum of the epoched data,\nextract SNR at stimulation frequency,\nplot the topography of the response,\nand statistically separate 12 Hz and 15 Hz responses in the different trials.\nSince the evoked response is mainly generated in early visual areas of the\nbrain the statistical analysis will be carried out on an occipital\nROI.\n"
