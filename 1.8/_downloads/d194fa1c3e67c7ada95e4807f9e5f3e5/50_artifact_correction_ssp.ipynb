        "<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>Before applying SSP (or any artifact repair strategy), be sure to observe\n    the artifacts in your data to make sure you choose the right repair tool.\n    Sometimes the right tool is no tool at all \u2014 if the artifacts are small\n    enough you may not even need to repair them to get good analysis results.\n    See `tut-artifact-overview` for guidance on detecting and\n    visualizing various types of artifact.</p></div>\n\n## What is SSP?\n\nSignal-space projection (SSP) :footcite:`UusitaloIlmoniemi1997` is a\ntechnique for removing noise from EEG\nand MEG signals by :term:`projecting <projector>` the signal onto a\nlower-dimensional subspace. The subspace is chosen by calculating the average\npattern across sensors when the noise is present, treating that pattern as\na \"direction\" in the sensor space, and constructing the subspace to be\northogonal to the noise direction (for a detailed walk-through of projection\nsee `tut-projectors-background`).\n\nThe most common use of SSP is to remove noise from MEG signals when the noise\ncomes from environmental sources (sources outside the subject's body and the\nMEG system, such as the electromagnetic fields from nearby electrical\nequipment) and when that noise is *stationary* (doesn't change much over the\nduration of the recording). However, SSP can also be used to remove\nbiological artifacts such as heartbeat (ECG) and eye movement (EOG)\nartifacts. Examples of each of these are given below.\n\n\n## Example: Environmental noise reduction from empty-room recordings\n\nThe `example data <sample-dataset>` was recorded on a Neuromag system,\nwhich stores SSP projectors for environmental noise removal in the system\nconfiguration (so that reasonably clean raw data can be viewed in real-time\nduring acquisition). For this reason, all the `~mne.io.Raw` data in\nthe example dataset already includes SSP projectors, which are noted in the\noutput when loading the data:\n\n"

        "Notice that the small peaks in the first to magnetometer channels (``MEG\n1411`` and ``MEG 1421``) that occur at the same time as the large EEG\ndeflections have also been removed.\n\n\n## Choosing the number of projectors\n\nIn the examples above, we used 3 projectors (all magnetometer) to capture\nempty room noise, and saw how projectors computed for the gradiometers failed\nto capture *global* patterns (and thus we discarded the gradiometer\nprojectors). Then we computed 3 projectors (1 for each channel type) to\ncapture the heartbeat artifact, and 3 more to capture the ocular artifact.\nHow did we choose these numbers? The short answer is \"based on experience\" \u2014\nknowing how heartbeat artifacts typically manifest across the sensor array\nallows us to recognize them when we see them, and recognize when additional\nprojectors are capturing something else other than a heartbeat artifact (and\nthus may be removing brain signal and should be discarded).\n\n\n## Visualizing SSP sensor-space bias via signal reconstruction\n.. admonition:: SSP reconstruction\n    :class: sidebar note\n\n    Internally, the reconstruction is performed by effectively using a\n    minimum-norm source localization to a spherical source space with the\n    projections accounted for, and then projecting the source-space data\n    back out to sensor space.\n\nBecause SSP performs an orthogonal projection, any spatial component in the\ndata that is not perfectly orthogonal to the SSP spatial direction(s) will\nhave its overall amplitude reduced by the projection operation. In other\nwords, SSP typically introduces some amount of amplitude reduction bias in\nthe sensor space data.\n\nWhen performing source localization of M/EEG data, these projections are\nproperly taken into account by being applied not just to the M/EEG data\nbut also to the forward solution, and hence SSP should not bias the estimated\nsource amplitudes. However, for sensor space analyses, it can be useful to\nvisualize the extent to which SSP projection has biased the data. This can be\nexplored by using ``proj='reconstruct'`` in evoked plotting functions, for\nexample via `evoked.plot() <mne.Evoked.plot>`, here restricted to just\nEEG channels for speed:\n\n"
