        "This tutorial focuses on visualization of epoched data. All of the functions\nintroduced here are basically high level matplotlib functions with built in\nintelligence to work with epoched data. All the methods return a handle to\nmatplotlib figure instance.\n\nEvents used for constructing the epochs here are the triggers for subject\nbeing presented a smiley face at the center of the visual field. More of the\nparadigm at `BABDHIFJ`.\n\nAll plotting functions start with ``plot``. Let's start with the most\nobvious. :func:`mne.Epochs.plot` offers an interactive browser that allows\nrejection by hand when called in combination with a keyword ``block=True``.\nThis blocks the execution of the script until the browser window is closed.\n\n"

        "The numbers at the top refer to the event id of the epoch. The number at the\nbottom is the running numbering for the epochs.\n\nSince we did no artifact correction or rejection, there are epochs\ncontaminated with blinks and saccades. For instance, epoch number 1 seems to\nbe contaminated by a blink (scroll to the bottom to view the EOG channel).\nThis epoch can be marked for rejection by clicking on top of the browser\nwindow. The epoch should turn red when you click it. This means that it will\nbe dropped as the browser window is closed.\n\nIt is possible to plot event markers on epoched data by passing ``events``\nkeyword to the epochs plotter. The events are plotted as vertical lines and\nthey follow the same coloring scheme as :func:`mne.viz.plot_events`. The\nevents plotter gives you all the events with a rough idea of the timing.\nSince the colors are the same, the event plotter can also function as a\nlegend for the epochs plotter events. It is also possible to pass your own\ncolors via ``event_colors`` keyword. Here we can plot the reaction times\nbetween seeing the smiley face and the button press (event 32).\n\nWhen events are passed, the epoch numbering at the bottom is switched off by\ndefault to avoid overlaps. You can turn it back on via settings dialog by\npressing `o` key. You should check out `help` at the lower left corner of the\nwindow for more information about the interactive features.\n\n"
