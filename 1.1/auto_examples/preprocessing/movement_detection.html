<p>Periods, where the participant moved considerably, are contaminated by low
amplitude artifacts. When averaging the magnetic fields, the more spread the
head position, the bigger the cancellation due to different locations.
Similarly, the covariance will also be affected by severe head movement,
and source estimation will suffer low/smeared coregistration accuracy.</p>
<p>This example uses the continuous head position indicators (cHPI) times series
to annotate periods of head movement, then the device to head transformation
matrix is estimated from the artifact-free segments. The new head position will
be more representative of the actual head position during the recording.</p>
