        "\n\n# Identify EEG Electrodes Bridged by too much Gel\n\nResearch-grade EEG often uses a gel based system, and when too much gel is\napplied the gel conducting signal from the scalp to the electrode for one\nelectrode connects with the gel conducting signal from another electrode\n\"bridging\" the two signals. This is undesirable because the signals from the\ntwo (or more) electrodes are not as independent as they would otherwise be;\nthey are very similar to each other introducting additional\nspatial smearing. An algorithm has been developed to detect electrode\nbridging :footcite:`TenkeKayser2001`, which has been implemented in EEGLAB\n:footcite:`DelormeMakeig2004`. Unfortunately, there is not a lot to be\ndone about electrode brigding once the data has been collected as far as\npreprocessing other than interpolating bridged channels. Therefore, our\nrecommendation is to check for electrode bridging early in data collection\nand address the problem. Or, if the data has already been collected, quantify\nthe extent of the bridging so as not to introduce bias into the data from this\neffect and exclude subjects with bridging that might effect the outcome of a\nstudy. Preventing electrode bridging is ideal but awareness of the problem at\nleast will mitigate its potential as a confound to a study. This tutorial\nfollows\nhttps://psychophysiology.cpmc.columbia.edu/software/eBridge/tutorial.html.\n\n"
